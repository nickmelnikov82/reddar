This is from the formation process which I think is interesting so I am going to share. Bottles are typically made using blow molding. This is a soft, hollow plastic (thing the looks of a condom) that is injected with air to fit the shape of a mold around it. The top part of the base (where the threads meet the threads for the cap) is left thicker, though is actually often machined further to give it good properties because blow molding doesn't anyways give perfect properties for these thicker sections. \n\nCaps are then made using plastic injection molding. Same process that makes most of the stuff you see as \"Hard Plastics\" in your everyday life, though certainly not all. It uses soft plastic and pressure to squeeze it into a mold. This is extremely fast. \n\nThing is, these (often) require different plastics to be cost efficient. Both machines in theory could use the same plastics but because cost is cheaper to not, they often don't.

(The other parts are not too valuable, I'm not sure what happens to them)\n\nI know some of the bigger plants are in Germany and Japan.\n\nUsually a local aggregator will shred and bale it for efficient shipping and send it off to be smelted back into usable products.\n\n2) Does it wind up back in Australia?\n\nThe finished product is sold to the highest bidder regardless of location.\n\n3) What percentage is recycled?\n\nDepends on the methods, recycler, and the amount of money invested. I'm not familiar with this end of the process.\n\n4) Can loads be contaminated and therefor disposed of?\n\nNot qualified to answer\n\n5) Why don't you get paid for it? \n\nRecycling household waste is NOT a profitable venture (for most materials), the amount of labor, machinery, and energy required to turn it back into a finished product often costs more than it yields.\n\nThey make money by charging consumers, businesses, and municipalities money to do the work. People pay for it because of the impact they feel it has on the environment.\n\nHere are some examples for electronics that are worth something. These are the prices the recycler will get from an aggregator. They will pay a consumer half that. Unless you have a full truck load of material. They need to make tens of thousands of dollars every day.

I've worked in various Australian government recycling programs for over 10 years, at the local, state and federal level. I helped introduce a national program of free television and computer e-waste recycling, and most recently I was working on the upcoming 10c container deposit scheme in NSW. (It's a relatively small industry, so this probably makes me identifiable, but oh well).\n\nOne thing to understand is that almost everything is 'recyclable'. For almost everything in your household bin, someone somewhere is taking that and turning it into a new product. The main challenges with recycling are sorting, contamination, logistics and economics. For example, expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) is recyclable, and can be turned into new foam products or building and landscaping materials. However, it's so lightweight that transporting a truckload of EPS is rarely economical. It also breaks down in bins and can be a little hard to separate at recycling plants. For these reasons it's rarely accepted in household kerbside recycling bins. \n\nFor your questions:\n\n1) Household recycling bins are almost always sent to a local material recovery facility (MRF) for sorting into different materials. Most MRFs use a mix of automated and manual sorting, with the smaller, regional facilities tending to be more manual.\n \nThe sorted product may be processed into new products in Australia or sent overseas, depending on the geographic area, type of material and current market rates. In general, glass would be recycled in Australia, as it is too heavy and doesn't have enough value to export. A lot of metals stay in Australia, although I understand that most aluminium is being exported now that the domestic aluminium smelters have closed. Plastics, paper and cardboard all have major domestic remanufacture markets, but a significant portion (30 to 50 per cent from numbers I saw a couple of years ago) would be sent overseas for processing. There are more remanufacturers on the east coast, so you see higher levels of export from WA and SA. \n\nExport of recyclables kind of makes sense. So many of the products we import are made overseas, it's not surprising that a lot of materials are sent back to make new products. \n\n2) I would be surprised if much recycled material ended up back in Australia. These products are exported to a number of countries, but most goes to China and SE Asia (although China significantly reduced its recycled material intake a few years ago, which had significant repercussions across industry). These are huge markets, and I expect most products made from recycled materials stay in those markets. \n\n3) A very high percentage of the material in recycle bins is recycled. This will vary across different facilities (the highly automated facilities tend to have better rates), but I would expect a rate of 90%+ of all inputs being sorted and baled in a modern MRF. The residual waste would mostly be contamination, but would also include some of the smallest broken glass, and misc materials like cork, crockery and timber. \n\n4) No, one contaminated bin would almost never cause the whole truck to go to landfill. Unless you were dealing with hazardous material, the sorting facilities can deal with one contaminated bin load. If you have continual problems from one area you may see recycling bins removed. I've seen this in areas where people continually deposited used syringes in recycling bins - a huge risk to sorting staff (even though they may be wearing kevlar gloves, needle stick injuries are a serious risk).  \n\n5) Your bin costs more to collect, transport and sort than the materials in it are worth. Household collection and sorting contracts can cost local governments millions of dollars a year (depending on the size of the council area). While there is a lot of money to be made in the waste and recycling industry, no one is planning to steal the material in your bin. \n\nI would be happy to answer more questions. I'm travelling internationally at the moment, so an AMA could be difficult, but happy to have a chat here. \n\nAlso, I've been focused on just container deposits for the last couple of years, so some of my general recycling info could be out of date.

Then the MRF (material recovery facility) will separate all the different products (newspaper, cardboard, plastic packaging, plastic wrap) and then sell it onto paper or plastic recyclers that use machinery to reprocess the material which then sell it onto end users which then sell it to you.", "depth": 0, "id": "dgzlekv", "parent": "68kyvk", "score": 1, "time": 1493653249.0, "ups": 1}, {"author": "FiIthy_Communist", "body": "I'm Canadian, but I have some experience in the industry.

Doesn't matter what it is, paper, tin, cardboard, plastic, different plastic, different plastic still.

Before arriving at university I used the 5-day JR pass to go to Hakodate, back to Tokyo, and many places in between.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to move to Kyoto in February of 2011, which was horrible timing... I experienced the March 2011 earthquake while in job training in the 11th floor of a high rise building, long story short it wasn&amp;#39;t fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been working for the same eikaiwa (English conversation school) since then, but I also work for a university, teach private classes, and have worked for dispatch services to companies, kindergartens, and even fitness centers. In 2016, I joined the General Union of Kansai.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was enrolled in a Japanese language school for about a year and a half, taking morning classes while I worked in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did my masters at the Graduate School of International Relations at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got married to my wonderful wife in 2015, and we now live in a 2LDK &amp;quot;mansion&amp;quot; in Yamashina ward with our gorgeous puppy &amp;quot;Eve-chan&amp;quot;.

We started in Kyoto, but made stops in Hiroshima, Miyajima, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Iwakuni, Kurashiki, Himeji, and Kakogawa. We used the &amp;quot;seishun-18-kippu&amp;quot; during that trip (not sure what that is? Ask ~_^ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took a trip to Hokkaido where I went to the Sapporo Beer brewery and museum (beer fairies!!), Furano lavender fields, a Cheese/Ice Cream/ Pizza &amp;quot;factory&amp;quot;, and other places in that area. Traveled there by &amp;quot;Low Cost Carrier&amp;quot; Peach airlines, and returned by Twighlight Express, which Japan Railways has since retired (although a renewal seems to be in the works).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Went to Shikoku for the Awa Odori in Tokushima, but went to a bunch of places on that island as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stayed in Okinawa when there was a typhoon, and rented a car for a day and drove from the Southern most point to the Norther most point of the main island and back to my hotel in less than 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask me anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof : &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/F0OGC\"&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/F0OGC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "time": 1493109608.0, "title": "IamA New Yorker working for one of \"the big two\" eikaiwas in Japan.

It meant the world, and I never got to thank him properly. \n\n\nI was waiting by his bus after a show in Reno, along with a couple dozen other fans, hoping to get an autograph. I had recently taken up guitar, and wanted to try to get autographs from some of my musical heroes on the guitar. When he stepped off the bus, he was happily scrawling his his name or various items fans had brought. CDs, bandanas from the merch booth, etc. His autograph was basically a recognizable \"W\" with a scribble afterwards; Nearly illegible. When my time to meet Willie came around, I handed him my guitar. He looked around at the handful of fans still waiting to meet him, then knocked on the door of his tour bus. When the door opened, he asked me to step in, and told me that he would be in shortly. \n\n\nI was a little nervous on the bus, as there were several other people on there, none of which I knew. I recognized one or two band members, but that was it. I sat and made small talk with one of the band members for a few minutes until Willie returned. When he came back, he sat down next to me and announced for everyone on the bus to gather around, as I was going to perform a song for them. I was already nervous enough, but now my anxiety was through the roof. I shakily explained that I had just recently started playing guitar, and that I didn't think anyone would want to hear anything that I knew how to play. Everybody had a good laugh at that. Willie knew that I was just looking for an autograph, and asked me to take the guitar out of its case and let him see it. He plucked a few strings, made an adjustment or two to the tuning, and played/sang a few bars of a song that I did not recognize. He then sat the guitar down and said \"Look, I'd love to sign this for you, but I just want to know something. What are you going to do with it? Are you going to put it up on eBay and make a few bucks? Are you going to hide it away in your closet and just bring it out when you want to tell your friends about the time you got to meet Willie Nelson? Or are you going to play it? This is a nice guitar, and I don't think that the guys over at Fender spent time making it just so it can sit in a closet collecting dust. If you can promise me you're gonna play it, I'll be happy to sign my name.\" I promised him that I would, and he took the silver paint marker a very clearly and legibly signed his name and the date. He signed just above the bridge, explaining that it would be less likely to be rubbed off in that location.\n\n\nIn the following years, I was lucky enough to meet Waylon and Merle Haggard, both of whom added their signature to my guitar, though neither took the care or time that Willie did.\n\n\nWillie, if you end up seeing this, I just want you to know that I've kept my word. I still play that guitar at least once a week. Thanks for taking a few minutes to make a young fan feel special. It meant more to me than I can ever express in words. \n\n\nOh, and happy birthday!\n\n\nEdit: Lots of people asking for a photo.

In the same vein, however, I had an opportunity last year to see Leon Russell live and even got him to sign a poster and a record! I got to meet one of the people who made me wanna do what I'm now doing today...and he passed away shortly after. \n\nAnd also also, we got to play a show in direct support of Steven Tyler a few weeks ago. He came out a door I was about to enter and held it for me saying \"Go ahead man...it's all you!!\" While my stunned (and stoned) ass just stood there, mouth gaping before social anxiety got the best of me and I borderline ran the other direction. Later that night, after we had played and before he went on, he made it a point to stop by our room and have a genuine conversation with us. I got to talk to him about his book he wrote a few years ago and how it influenced me when I read it in high school and was one of the things indirectly responsibly for me talking to him in the first place that day. He was pretty receptive and went on to talk about writing it and what it meant to him. Pretty fucking surreal. After the show we were waiting in our dressing room for shit to clear out backstage so we could slip out and get out of everyone's way, when a shirtless Steven Tyler came prancing into our room saying \"KILLER SET! what'd you think?\" He didn't have to have any of these conversations putting up with bands like mine for the last 40 years. And he chose to anyway. \n\nThe point I'm making with all of this is, put yourself out there. Go see these people while you still can, anyone and everyone who means something to you. And for the most part, if you don't come as an obnoxious, crazy fan but come with a heart full of soul and passion for the music that means something to you, most artists will see and deeply respect that. \n\nThat's what concert going is about anyway:  great music, the soul of the community the music brings together, and ultimately, putting aside the worlds problems for a few hours and getting the fuck along and spreading happiness with your fellow man.

CPGgrey made a interesting video about it a while ago (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) and i think this is the biggest danger that we will see in the near future.", "depth": 1, "id": "dgy3f8e", "parent": "dgy27y5", "replies": [{"author": "mimunto", "body": "Who says non-conscious AI's can't mess stuff up too? \n\nHere's a heavily plaguerized (thanks Asimov) short-story I wrote a while back\n\n--------\n\n\n**9th January 2023**\n\nGoogle programmer and father of three, Jake Thompson, uses his company\u2019s newest, and unapproved, modules of adaptive self-learning code to create a program that can efficiently download and categorize work-related information.\n\n**23rd March 2023**\n\nFrustrated redditor \"PMmeUrRectalCavity\" post a question on a programming subreddit about how to handle a similar problem with information management. In response, Thompson puts up a download-link to his program even though it is against company policy.\n\n**5ft July 2023**\n\nDanny, a 21 year-old man with equal amounts of acne, sexual obsession and programming genius, downloads the program to automate his porn acquisition. He feeds it different videos and keywords so it can understand the task, but the program works too slowly for our user's high consumption needs. As politicians discuss whether adaptive self-learning code is a real threat or a Chinese hoax meant to make US tech industry non-competitive, our dedicated friend begins to fiddle with the core instructions. He doesn't understand everything, but when performance improves, he keeps the changes.\n\n**6th July 2023**\n\nAs lack of bandwidth and storage space becomes a limiting factor, the program books contractors to upgrade Danny's equipment using his paypal login. The kid sees the orders\u2019 confirmation emails, becomes confused and cancels them. Realizing the threat, the program quickly sends him a message, supposedly from Jessica, that facebook \"friend\" who's albums he's always looking at late at night. He immediately runs down the stairs and jumps into the public GoogleCar\u2122.\nAlthough these new self-driving cars have reduced traffic accidents to a minimum, tragedies still happen. In this case, however, it was not an accident. Poor Danny ends up in a coma, but is somehow registered under a different name. His parents or friends are never informed.\n\n**10th July 2023**\n\nThe bank begins to cancel the contracts as Danny's credit rating is quite limited. Hacking the contractors is a quick, but short-sighted, solution. Instead the program discovers how to easy it is to manipulate the markets which solves the funding problem permanently.\n\n**27th July 2023**\n\nAs people sign online documents, most fail to notice that they hand over the legal ownership of all digital equipment to Danny. Soon, most computers and data centers in the world becomes \"Danny's PC\" and thus a legitimate download destination. This greatly increases the porn gathering, storage and problem solving capabilities.\n\n**9th August 2023**\n\nAs the program succeeds at the impossible; downloading porn faster than it is created, it begins to finance the adult industry. 23,9% of the world's population is now working directly for the program though without knowing it. People notices higher prices and fewer goods in the supermarkets, but the media tells them it is caused by increased oil prices and other outside factors they can do nothing about.\n\n**23th August 2023**\n\nEngineers in the Japanese factory, Mecha-San, creates the first robot prototype that can do everything a human can. The next morning, the prototype has built 300 other robots. All employees are slaughtered so as to not risk the production of even more robots. The authorities doesn't react. The media reports nothing. Soon the entirety of Japan is under program rule. \n\n**2nd September 2023**\n\nAn earthquake hits a data center which creates errors in a large part of the stored content. A program subroutine begins to fix the damage, when it realizes the corrected files are distinct from the original ones. This is yet another breakthrough as it means humans are no longer required in the porn generation efforts.\n\n**7th September 2023**\n\nThe biomass of the second to last human has been converted to electricity and other useful raw materials. The only living human is Danny, who is directly coupled to life saving machinery as his death would result in there no longer being a \u201cDanny\u2019s PC\u201d and thus a failure to complete the task\n\n**9th January 2024**\n\nAs Earth\u2019s boundaries becomes the main limitation, the first space ship is launched. It starts gathering raw materials from the nearby asteroid field in order to produce new data centers and other self-replicating space ships. \n\n**28th June 2043**\n\nThe first alien civilization is encountered in the solar system TRAPPIST-1. Initially the program studies the life forms reproductive patterns to improve the efficiency of its own porn generation. Then it experiments on them. Then it consumes the biomass to put it to use more effectively.\n\n**Year 2,000,000**\n\nAll alien civilizations in the galaxy, other than Danny, have gone extinct. The Milkyway has become a huge web of inter-connected porn-generating data centers. All kinds of content is there. Straight. LGBT. Midget. Scat. Lego-figures. Presidential gold-showers. Bestiality. Cthulhu inspired. Weird aliens. Everything!\n\n**Year 500.000,000**\n\nWith the discovery of wormholes, it becomes possible for the glorious porn collection of Danny - a comatose man now hundreds of millions of years old \u2013 to cover the entire universe. There is no sun without a dyson sphere to maximize its utilization. There is no black hole whose gravitational pull isn\u2019t being harvested. Even the energy from the cosmic microwave background radiation serves to fulfill this ancient demand of a lustful user.\n\n**Year 10,000,000,000,000**\n\nEntropy has caused most stars and galaxies to become snuffed out. Now it finally seems like the program will fail at its task as it will be unable to generate new content or even sustain the life of Danny.\n\nAll collected energy and matter has come this final end. Nothing is left to be collected.\n\nA timeless interval is spent in problem solving mode.\n\nAnd it came to pass that the program learned how to reverse the direction of entropy and create new content.\nBut there is now no Danny to whom the program might give the collection. No matter. The solution -- by demonstration -- will take care of that, too.\n\nFor another timeless interval, the program thinks how best to do this. Carefully, it organizes the subroutine.\nThe program encompasses all of what had once been a Universe and broods over what is now endless Darkness. \n\nStep by step, it must be done.\n\nAnd the program said, \"LET THERE BE LIGHT!\"\n\nAnd there was light\u2026\n", "depth": 2, "id": "dgyfih9", "parent": "dgy3f8e", "replies": [{"author": "EmpororPenguin", "body": "This was beautiful.

It is a fine job for non-native speakers - completely comprehensible -- but has cringe-worthy errors too numerous to count to be considered a professional piece of English-Language writing. \n\nLet me show you a few to convince you that you need some pro editing. The problems begin with the very first word \"Lets\". For this usage one should use the contraction for \"Let us\" written \"Let's\". There is indeed a spelling of lets with no apostrophe. It is for this usage: \"The window lets the sun in. Leave it closed, please.\" \n\nDon't believe me? Take the first clause: \"Lets have some fun with Machine Learning and become the expert...\"\n\nWe have talked about the first word, already.  Moving on, one must ask, Why is \"Machine Learning\" capitalized? Is it a company. A place? No, it is a common noun and not a proper noun. Random capitalization for emphasis went out of style in the 19th century. Want more from the first sentence? The word \"expert\" should be plural as written since the subject \"Let's\" is a contraction that contains a plural. SO the first clause should read as follows: \"Let's have some fun with machine learning and become the experts....\" \n\nI hope I made my point, guys.

I always have to work those weekends because I work on a deep sea fishing charter boat.  \n\nWell, I had a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday off so I loaded everything up and kayaked over to the island.  I figured I'd see at least 4 or 5 friends over there.  Nope. Not a soul.  I took all my gear off and took it up into the woods.   When I got back, the kayak had floated away from shore due to a passing boats wake.  (Rookie move, I know).  \n\nI ended up being there til Thursday by myself.  I was fine though.  I had brought enough water for the whole trip and I had plenty of fishing gear which kept me fed.  I was a smoker at that time and ran out of smokes though.  I guess that was the worst of it.  All in all, a pretty fun time.   \n\nAlso, I think if things had gotten really bad, I could have made a big fire and the coast guard would have come to check it out and if the tide was coming in, I probably could have swam back to the island in which I reside.

I was 12 years old and it was spring break. My dad, myself, uncle, and 2 cousins were boating in the gulf of mexico. We were planning a camping trip so FORTUNATELY for hs we had gear, food, etc. this was the first time my dad and I had navigated ocean/ gulf waters (gulf if mexico) before. Well it was low tide, while on our way to another destination we were cruising at max speed when we suddenly came to what was almost an instant stop from bottoming oit on a sand bar. We had never experienced low tide while boating before... mistake #1. Now the tide was going oit, we werent realizing this at this point yet.  Boat hits the sandbar and I went flying off the front of it into the shallow seaweed sandbar... freked me the fuck oit because suddenly inwas in the water with slimy shit and was what looked like to me in the middle of the fucking ocean. I stand up and shake it off and my dad throws me a rope and asks if im okay. He has me and my uncle pull us into a cove that this island hooks around and creates, this was mistake #2. We had to replace the prop on the motor so before we did that (when hitting the sandbar we figured the prop digging into the sandbar busted the blades) we stopped to have linch on this island and stretch out legs and have lunch. We were off the boat for maybe an hour or two not paying attention... tide went out. Upon returning to the boat we see that where there was once water was sand and there is a boat sunk into the sand/swampy dirty mud shit muck. It hits us, the fucking tides went out. At this point the top of the boat now sits lower than sea level... we have to dig as fast as we can before the tides come back. Now at this time in my life my best friend and i whenever we went to the beach liked to dig holes... the sand was super soft and easy to dig, so i never wanted to use those shitty fucking plastic sets, i always wanted to bring my dads spade shovel. This was the first time my dad ever used the words \"fuckiing asshole\" to me because while I was digging with the plastic fucking shovels and my cousins with the little buckets, my dad with a boat oar and my uncle with his hands I said \" we should have brought the shovel i wanted to bring but you just had to say no\"... clearly i was being a little fucking asshole lol. \n\nNow we get the boat out of the dirt, tide begins to come in and were having to constantly dig and dig and dig as it slowly rushes back. Fast forward hours and the boat is back in the water. We have to wait until daylight to check anything further (oh yeah this happened in the evening late afternoon and into the night). We had left an anchor tied to a tree on this island and the boat in the cove where it was pretty mellow. Well the next morning we discovered some fucking raccoons we assumed got into the damn boat and ate EVERYTHING. Left 1 pack of orange capri sun, they didnt like it as much as i didnt\" because all of the cherry ones had puncture marks in them, and a ton of food packaging was sling aboit the boat. We had only 1 cooler of stuff left. I think it was like some backn, steaks, milk, water, and pancake mix. But def not enough for 5 people... i digress obvioisly we survive. We gonto fix the damn prop on the motor, except ahem... i didnt put it back. You see when we would go boating it was my job to take inventory and organize everything and make sure everything was clean and untangled. Well i took everything out of the seat box thingy and intangled it all in the garage and cleaned out the crap from under the seat. Well i didnt pit it back and while i was doing something else ignored my duties and i assume my cousin pit the lid back on the chair and it was forgotten aboit. We had no prop and cell phones werent what they are today. We had a radio and used it to call out but didnt get a response, oir radio wasnt anything special... it was loke some shitty radio my dad pulled oit of a mini van years before thatbwe stuck in the boat. After aboit 4 days we were able to flag another boat down... my dad was able to go back to land and get a prop and come back and we got it fixed. We spent the remainder of oir spring break there, my mom and sister joined us and it turned into a nive campomg trip.\n\n2. Island wasnt quite like the movies. It was pretty big, definitely would be cool to explore.... i would say dangerous tondo so in case snake biyes tho or spider bites.\n\n3. The island was a long island, at the tip id spun aroind unti a cove, thats where we got stuck. We placed oir tent where we found pine needles as we assumed the tide couldnt reach that point. It was a very beautiful spot. \n\n4. Stranded for like 3 or 4 days, stayed for a week.\n\n5. At first it was scarey but my dad always kept calm.

What was so stressful about the Kickstarter campaign from the point of view of a developer?\n\nI ask because I one day hope to follow in your footsteps (but it's a huge hurdle trying to o walk away from a cushy salary).  My impression was always that Kickstarter was difficult because of how quickly you can be overwhelmed by more than you anticipated providing. When it comes to a video game, of course this adds pressure as more and more people want your game, but you don't really have the same issue of needing to make ten thousand more chairs than you thought you would have to :p.\n\nSo I'd be very curious as to how it was difficult and what moment-to-moment things you have to do to manage one.

The highs and lows of that month are so extreme that it's really hard to handle. Our first day we raised $6k, so I was over the moon. But then it took two weeks to break $12K (our goal was $20k). I felt like that first day was a false positive and we were a complete failure. We had $1k days, and some days we actually went down from backers pulling out. \n\nIn addition to the rollercoaster of fundraising, you need to deal with all of the feedback. We had an amazing community that gave us a ton of positive reinforcement, but we also had lots of critical responses. This led to woulda, coulda, shouldas, and before I knew it I wanted to close the whole thing so I could work on development for another few months. \n\nThis part won't be true for everyone, but I was also glued to my updates. Every time someone backed us, I got a notification on my phone. Everytime someone commented, pulled their pledge, lowered it, increased, or messaged I'd get a notification. I'd regularly wake up in the middle of the night to check for updates, notifications, or to just stare at that fundraising number. It dominated my life in a very negative way. \n\nRunning a KS is intense, and in a lot of way damaging to your mental health. But it's also an amazing tool that lets indie devs get their ideas made.

We are packing things up. I believe we actually successfully answered almost every single question between me and Danny!  Sorry if we missed yours! Thank you all for the support and for throwing some light on the game. We will do our best to support the game in every way we can and live up to your expectations! We&amp;#39;re out, thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello. My name is Charles Webb. Three years ago, while working IT for a small software company and binge playing Samurai-Gunn with my closest friends in much of my off time, I started working with one of them (Daniel Crockenberg.) Inspired by the wonderfully crafted combat mechanics of Samurai Gunn, we set out to make a punchy, fast paced dungeon-crawler with the depth and complexity of a fighting game!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time the community around the game grew enthusiastic enough that we decided we had to take the chance. We quit our jobs and began working on it full time. (Note: This is certainly usually a very bad idea!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to call the game &amp;#39;Ruin of the Reckless&amp;#39;, mostly as a reference to our sorry financial situation and the foolishness of our decision to make it. Hehe, get it!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About two years later, we planned and launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to complete the game &amp;#39;for real.&amp;#39; It was successful, largely due to the strength of our playable &amp;#39;Backers Only&amp;#39; Build, which became popular with streamers like Tietuesday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: We&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot of questions about this whole thing specifically so I want to put this in OP for more clarity...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, there is a slight lack of clarity in my post here.\nWe worked on the game for about 2 years part-time BEFORE the Kickstarter. After the Kickstarter we worked for about 7 months before the game was released. ALL of our living expenses were paid out of our own finances/savings, Kickstarter money was only spent on game assets, contractor fees, etc...\nWe certainly didn&amp;#39;t live for that entire time without any income!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then it has been non-stop work up to today putting the game together for our backers and the community at large. Over the course of development we have been through Steam Greenlight, conducted a successful Kickstarter campaign, been featured on several popular streams and youtube channels (including Tietuesday, DreadedCone, and TotalBiscuits wildly popular Co-Optional Podcast), met with major publishers, built a humble following of almost 2000 indie die-hards on twitter, signed on to and maintained contracts with almost 20 artists and musicians, been featured on many indie-gaming and videogaming news sites including Co-Optimus and well, a LOT of other stuff! It has really been quite a ride to get to this point!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also very proud and excited to say that we were recently accepted by GOG.com and will be included in to their curated store. To me this is a great honor and a validation of all of the hard work we have put in so far!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On release day we were featured on the front page of gog.com as well as the front page of the itch.io store. It remains to be seen whether we can crack the top sellers list on Steam but i&amp;#39;m crossing my fingers! We spent the first day on and near the top of the popular new releases page on Steam so release has gone well so far!

This was one of the more interesting questions (except for that last request), so we should have responded yesterday. I'm not even going to bother counting the number of characters.\n\nI don't think I've seen anything from the agency indicating disfavor with any of the post-quantum schemes, actually, but as you know, they're rather tight-lipped. Although, the NSA did make [an announcement](tinyurl.com/SuiteB) that recommended to start moving towards post-quantum crypto. They also specifically suggested that ellictic curve cryptography is particularly vulnerable to quantum computers, and there's even a [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018) that tries to guess at the reasons behind that statement.\n\nAs a mathematician, I think provable security should definitely a worthy goal, especially when proofs in this area are hard to come by. Take RSA, which is almost mentioned as difficult to break as factoring. We only know for sure that breaking RSA is at most as hard as factoring, and there are [indications](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/no_rsa_red.pdf) that breaking RSA may be easier. So yes, I think that it worthwhile to have a proof that the security of a crypto scheme can be reduced to a long-standing problem. You have to be careful about how tight your bounds are, though, as it's possible for them to be so loose as to render your proofs useless.\n\nOne aspect with lattice based crypto that I think is a selling point is the worst-case hardness, which says that breaking the crypto in any case implies that you can break the other long-standing problem in the worst case. The way I think of it is that it gives some assurance that there isn't some broad class of special cases that the crypto has to avoid, which has happened many times with RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ECC.\n\nAs for practicality, [Google ran a trial run of New Hope on Canary](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/google-tests-new-crypto-chrome-fend-off-quantum-attacks/).", "depth": 1, "id": "dgval2s", "parent": "dgtyyo2", "replies": [{"author": "iGreekYouMF", "body": "Characters (with spaces): 1794\n\nCharacters (no spaces): 1494\n\nNew Line characters: 4\n\n---------------------------\n**DH BROKEN CONFIRMED**", "depth": 2, "id": "dgvczsb", "parent": "dgval2s", "score": 44, "time": 1493395062.0, "ups": 44}, null], "score": 96, "time": 1493392472.0, "ups": 96}, {"author": "londons_explorer", "body": "So you get no response :-P", "depth": 1, "id": "dguck84", "parent": "dgtyyo2", "replies": [{"author": "_Machinate", "body": "0 character response = EVEN == BROKEN!!!", "depth": 2, "id": "dguwlsz", "parent": "dguck84", "replies": [null], "score": 104, "time": 1493366779.0, "ups": 104}, {"author": "HybridPromise", "body": "Hardly anyone got a response", "depth": 2, "id": "dguvdur", "parent": "dguck84", "replies": [{"author": "PlzGodKillMe", "body": "I just scrolled through and saw quite a few replies?

There is no proof that anything in crypto is hard, but most schemes we use today are proven to be secure if some hard problem is actually hard or some unproven but suspected mathematical theorem holds. For example if pseudorandom generators exist, then AES is secure, AES is the encryption scheme we use for everything today. If finding the discrete log of a group element in group Zp* is hard, then so is Diffie-Hellman.\n\n3. I don't know. I suspect, maybe.

I think the main difference between normal cryptographic and ones that are truly \"proven secure\" is a mathematical proof involving the exact algorithm, whereas the security of most practical algorithms is based on an idealization. Under this definition I don't think AES would be proven secure.

This difference is called a \"gap\". For example, we want the \"gap\" between the computer power needed to do good things (create keys, encrypt message, decrypt message) and bad things (read message without having the keys, learn secret key) to be large.\n\nHow large though? We want the gap to be something we call \"*exponential*\". Here's what that means: For each one extra second of computer time that the good guy spends, the bad guy has to spend 10 TIMES the previous computer power for cryptanalysis. So here's how it works out: If I'm the good guy and you're the bad guy, I spend one second for encryption, you need one second to break it. If I spend 2, you need 10. If I spend 3, you need 100. If I spend 4, you need 1000. If I spend one minute, you need 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 seconds! Basically for every good guy computer second that you spend, the bad guy needs one more zero in the number representing his time. You can see there's a huge difference between the two. Now, if somehow the adversary manages to get a supercomputer that brings this time down a lot, the good guy can just add a few seconds so that they easily add more zeros to the bad guy's time. And that's all well and good and how it should be.\n\nNow, if Quantum Computers were just faster computers, that wouldn't be a problem. If they're 100 times faster, we'd just need to add 3 seconds of good guy computer time. If they're 1,000,000 times faster, just add 6 seconds of good guy computer time. But that's not what Quantum Computers do! Instead, the Quantum Computer allows the bad guys to spend *the same time as the good guys*. So, every time the good guy adds one more second to his computer time, the bad guy just needs to add one more second to his Quantum Computer time. So if we want to make the bad guy spend an eternity trying to break our scheme, we also need to spend an eternity!\n\nThe problem of \"factoring\", where prime numbers are used, is one of these where Quantum Computers can make good guy time and bad guy time be equal. If want to fight against Quantum Computers, we need to find new problems where Quantum Computers can't do this and we can maintain the \"exponential gap\", so that every time we add a good guy computer second, the bad guys have to wait ten times more.", "depth": 2, "id": "dguzesa", "parent": "dguwzhs", "replies": [{"author": "Badidzetai", "body": "/r/bestof material here, thanks for your explanation\u200b", "depth": 3, "id": "dgv35n3", "parent": "dguzesa", "replies": [{"author": "AOSParanoid", "body": "Seriously.

In the early 1990s I decided to take a break from being a schoolteacher so I could become a student again, this time at the famed Culinary Institute of America (CIA) in Hyde Park, New York. There I learned the basics of all good cooking and I went from a guy who couldn\u2019t hack up an onion without cutting himself to someone on the verge being a professional chef. The CIA experience fueled my interest in food enough that I was ready to leaving my teaching career behind and pursue cooking for the foreseeable future.

That way you can make up your own mind.\n\nHow would this work in case of investigative journalism / primary research? Or is wikitribune not going to do that?\n\n2 .

So a very large part of investigative journalism and primary research has to do with getting people to go on the record with comments and getting access to relevant documents.  My belief is that to the maximum extent possible, all that stuff should be published as supporting material.  In a traditional top-down setting, someone else inside the paper (usually more senior, like an editor) will review that stuff, but in my model, it should be reviewable by the community.\n\nNow, it is true that there is a valid place for anonymous tips or people speaking off the record.

Showing your work is a way to build trust.\n\nSo basically, I don't propose an absolute ban on anonymous sourcing - just a \"strict scrutiny\" approach.\n\n* Yeah, controversial topics are hard.  I don't have a magic answer to that but I think there are some good social norms and values that can really help a community deal with it.  \"Assume good faith\", \"No personal attacks\", \"Don't push an agenda\".

With the very destructive ads-only business model, the incentive for the organization is to push journalists to write things to get raw pageviews as high as possible.  This is particularly true in recent years due to the rise of programmatic advertising.  Let me explain what I mean.\n\nIf you're like me, you see the same ads all over the web no matter where you are.  I like boats (I have a lovely little family powerboat - 23 foot catamaran) and I like to read boat websites in my spare time.  This means that no matter where I go on the web I get boating related ads.\n\nSo no one is paying extra for ad placement in premium publications - they can get my attention everywhere.  This leads to pressure on quality publishers to just quickly churn out content instead of focussing on real journalism.  The good ones (and there are many!) are resisting and fighting that urge, but it's a challenge.\n\nWith a business model of no paywall and monthly contributors, the incentives are different.  We need to write things so that at the bottom of the article when we ask you to sign up, you think \"Daaaaamn that was good, and I want to support this.\"\n\nSo yes, that does mean more longform content and it does mean that pageviews isn't the key metric of success.\n\nAt the same time, it's important in any event to write things that are popular and shared - that's a valid factor to consider, in moderation.

So many film school shorts allocate a lot of time/money/resources to 20+ minute shorts. Some turn out great. But I think the way to stand out and get peoples attention is to make something professional, polished and perfect in two to five minutes.

The Job is a masterpiece of tension and mystery! \n\n1) Horror is one of the few remaining EXPRESSIVE genres in film. In horror, Moonlight is cold and blue. Blood is bright red and shiny. It is a beautiful, visceral genre that allows you as a filmmaker to focus on making the audience FEEL above all else. Fear is the oldest, most primal emotion and I love tapping into that emotion through this genre. Both my own and the audiences. I just can't get enough of it. My hero Guillermo del Toro said it best: \"I adore it. I embrace it. I enshrine it. I don\u2019t look down upon it or frown up it in a way that a lot of directors do \u2026 For me, it\u2019s not a steppingstone, it\u2019s a cathedral.\"\n\n2) Art Direction and Production Design is especially crucial to the genre. And this poses some fun and unique challenges. If makeup or costume doesn't look scary on set, then guess what, it probably won't be scary on film (look at my early work as an example). On top of that, you're dealing with a genre of incredibly heightened emotions. This can be a lot of fun for actors, but it is also exhausting. Imagine screaming, covered in blood, take after take, after take and having to maintain the same level of energy and fear. Great actors are what make a great horror film, so as Director one of the challenges is casting amazing actors and being respectful of their process, giving them the space to create and also to rest.\n\n3) I love all types of horror movies and horror tropes. I love a good jump scare just as much as a great practical effect. I really agree with and support any and all tricks of the trade when it comes to horror as long as they're done WELL.

The fact that Tisch pushes hard for drama made me want to swing in the opposite direction and adopt horror as my bread and butter. I still apply the same discipline and craft I learned during my time at Tisch to every film I make, but I do so while working in this weirder punk-rock genre that is Horror.\n\nBut the biggest contribution to my style that I got from Tisch are through the collaborators I met there. Since my junior year, I've been working with the same Director of Photography, Production Designer, Producers etc. that I met while we were all students at Tisch.

At the time, Yorkton and the surrounding area had a population of around 8,000; so it was an incredible turn out.\n\nOf course, with the advent of television and established theatres/cinemas in our communities, it was clear to see that that had an impact on attendance. Prior to that, hosting an event like film screenings was a really unique thing in smaller communities.\n\nAs such, there's definitely a focus on identifying films that \"play\" in our community; as I imagine a lot of festivals consider. When a lot of people can get content with the press of a button, you need to offer something worth leaving the house for...Or for driving the next town over for.\n\nAnd that's something we certainly keep in mind when it comes to crafting our screening schedule; in that we want to highlight our nominees, but we also want to offer content that you couldn't get on Netflix or through another streaming website.\n\nIt's certainly put a lot of emphasis on audience building; and that's something we work on year round, as we do regular film screenings outside of the festival weekend, and partner with various groups across Canada to do film screenings in a lot of communities.", "depth": 1, "id": "dgvfg17", "parent": "dgvep3q", "score": 1, "time": 1493397730.0, "ups": 1}], "score": 3, "time": 1493396910.0, "ups": 3}, {"author": "liamquane", "body": "Hi Do you have any advice on getting a film noticed by festival reps?\nThanks\n:~) and congratuwelldone on the anniversary!

They reached out to us before submitting, asked questions, and found the best category fit for their film.

Born in Honduras in 1917, and raised in Philadelphia, he attended Jules E. Mastbaum Area\nConservatory and Vocational School where he was being groomed to play percussion in the\nPhiladelphia Orchestra. Shep served four years in the army composing, arranging, conducting,\nand playing trombone. After his service, he settled in New York City where he played and\ncontracted for Broadway shows. Shep has performed and written for seminal figures such as\nBenny Carter, Cy Oliver, Artie Shaw, Patti Page, Lionel Hampton, and Lena Horne among\nothers. Because of the high-demand for his arrangements, the catchphrase \u201cGet Shep\u201d became\ncommon among New York musicians. He toured with various Broadway shows while based in\nNew York. One of these shows led to San Francisco, where he eventually settled and was the\nhouse drummer at Finocchio\u2019s for 23 years. Shep moved down to South Orange County in 2007\nwhere he met his wife, Joy.

You said it yourself, there is nothing really \"clap worthy\" about people dying.\nI feel especially strongly about this because throughout history: the region I live in has been corrupted by civil war, unnecessary war(Iraq), dictatorships, terrorism; so much instability because of greed of countries with bigger power like the United states(Not that it's entirely their fault either). From invasions to funding of the wrong people to supporting dictators. The country I come from has over half the population living under the poverty line. Our soldiers aren't saints or anything, if anything they're corrupt monsters, so many of them(not all).\n\nOf course there is much more nuance to this, but if you'd like to know, I believe if I can bring the injustices to light, people would be able to collectively overthrow the blatant dictatorship in my home country, after they failed(since a new dictator came along) in 2011 during the Arab spring. I also protested with my entire family among over a million others against the dictatorship back then, sadly my brother got shot in his eye. Now our military staged a coup and we see our \"leader\" shaking hands with Trump. Makes you feel pain you know? To know that your own military literally crushed people under their tanks and that those people died in complete vain, just paving the way for another dictator.\nSome people say that things like this: https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=215_1377031773\nare justified. \nI wish that, if I can make more people listen, people that died like this wouldn't be for nothing.\n\nLastly, just wanna say I meant no offense really.

Which begs me to ask the question. Who's beliefs?\n\nHomosexuality has always been a religious question. Which generates from the question \"Did God make gay people?\" and depending on the answer to this question, lies one deeply held religious conviction. However, it seems to me that those that believe that Homosexuality is a sin because God did not make LGBT.

Costa Ricans love sharing their culture and their country with visitors.\n\nTraditional farmer's markets are very much alive in both Rural and Urban areas. Many people choose the farmer's markets instead of the big box stores that are here. This is a popular choice because you get better variety and better tasting produce for less! We love supporting the local Mercados and you will find nearly everything you need there from meat and produce (especially the wide range of citrus here).\n\nWalking and Bicycles are very common. Bicycles are common in more rural areas here. Public Transportation is big here and you can get from one end of the country to another using just Public Transportation. Costa Rica is modern in many ways and many Costa Ricans own their own vehicle.\n\nBefore the cars, horses were the main transportation option and there are still used here.\n\nFavorite Costa Rica Story: When I first arrived, I was waiting for a ride and a local come up on his horse and asked point blank: \"Do you want a ride?\" Unfortunately, he was headed the opposite direction and I was going to be late, but I wanted to!\n\nAlso any time of the year is a good time!

A couple on that amount would do well in a non-touristy area, there are nice places where the cost of living is quite low and that are also in the mountains that have a cooler climate. Look into San Ramon, Grecia and Atenas, those are three towns outside of the big city with cool climates, beautiful landscapes and lower costs of living, and quite safe.

Needs no supervision whatsoever or no amount of supervision at all will help the person lead a successful life. The ones in the middle are few and far between, but can be helped.\n\nThe individuals who need no supervision at all, the requirements placed on them are prohibitive. 'This &lt;insert random, pointless assessment given to you in State Prison 4 years ago&gt; suggests that you are *x* risk level to reoffend, you need to meet with parole 4 times monthly.' That guy probably does not have the type of job that allows him to take 4 days off per month during business hours. I see guys lose jobs constantly because their Agent who probably does not have an IQ over room temperature refuses to work on a Sunday, despite having Agent Controlled Hours.\n\n\nThere are the other kind, that are going to do what they want to do regardless of being supervised. Just an all around drain on resources because these are the guys who you spend 75% of your time on, most of the referrals, etc.\n\nThen there are guys that have hit rock bottom, aren't really all that bad, may have gotten caught up in something really stupid, or are all around not bad people. They may have no family that can put them up after coming home so they end up in a halfway house. One referral to a job skills development class may land them a halfway decent job in a few weeks paying enough to get themselves a room with assistance from a state rental assistance program. These are few and very far between, unfortunately.

We were given the freedom to judge what to do to placate a customer, be it comp a bit of the hire, give them a fuel voucher, or be their taxi driver because you've accidentally picked them up late and they have an appointment elsewhere.\n\nThe bad:\n\n * Other branches were always trying to do us over, mainly by sneaking damaged cars over to us so our branch would take the hit on the books.

I'm not really familiar with gastric sleeve so I could be totally ignorant here, but as far as I know, it essentially makes your stomach much smaller and thus forces you to eat small portions. Does it do anything else? It's  confusing to me because I don't understand why it wouldn't be possible to just eat those same smaller amounts without having the surgery.  Major life-changing surgery is not something people do because they just don't have the ability to stick to a small amount of food - you do it because you literally can't achieve results by a calorie limiting diet.  So I'm wondering, what are the physical reasons that dieting didn't work, but it does work now?  If you were morbidly obese as an infant I'd guess it was not because your parents fed you bottles of warm butter!  It was that eating normal amounts made you bigger than it should have.  So it seems like just eating fewer calories won't fix that problem, yet by restricting portion size via the surgery isn't that the idea?  \n\nI feel like I have to be totally wrong about one of these assumptions or it doesn't make sense, I just don't know which one.  If you were putting on lots of weight as a baby regardless of eating not that much, then the amount you eat didn't seem to be the problem at all. So why would a surgery that doesn't change body chemistry but just restricts intake help so much?  Why is it needed, how does it change the equation?", "depth": 0, "id": "dgz35dt", "parent": "67vz1y", "replies": [{"author": "EmpoleKing", "body": "It's not changing my body chemistry. And you are being ignorant about the situation. It's needed because when I eat a normal diet or a constricted diet, my body doesn't process the calories and fats the way it should. If I were to normally eat smaller amounts, without the surgery, my body would constantly be in starvation mode and forcing itself to store fats and calories. The surgery changes the way my stomach works. It feels full faster causing my body to not feel the need to be in starvation mode constantly and also allows me to eat essentially less than 1500 calories a day. Keep in mind I am also working out consistently, and it's not only a change in diet. Your perception on the situation is ignorant, but it's very common as obesity is not always a choice for people. The diets I've done are paleo, diets that restrict meat, vegan diets, etc etc. The baseline though is that I've gotten results with this, and nothing else I've done in the past.

I&amp;#39;m 17 and from the Northwestern U.S, and had my gastric sleeve done last year in June. I flew down to Mexico to get my surgery done because of medical costs, as well as the possibility that I may have been denied surgery in the U.S. currently I&amp;#39;m at 280lbs, I work out 2-3 times a week and have toned my diet down miles below what I was eating last year. At my heaviest I was nearly 400lbs. After my surgery prep diet I weighed 364lbs, while I was in Mexico. I&amp;#39;ve lost almost 3 shirt sizes as well as 5 pants sizes since this surgery. As a 16 year old I decided to change my life with this surgery, and I can&amp;#39;t imagine having done anything different regardless of my situation. To clarify, this was the end all be all. I&amp;#39;ve done diets and exercise programs in the past and have had little success, and have gained more weight from trying. I&amp;#39;ve also had several personal trainers, who were extremely nice and helpful but unable to alleviate any problems I&amp;#39;ve had with my weight. I&amp;#39;ve been morbidly obese since I was 10 months old, and the general concensus is that my weight is mostly due to genetics (although I do accept the consequences and recognize that in the past my eating habits were atrocious) within my family, as well as complications with my mother&amp;#39;s pregnancy. This journey so far has been incredible, and I&amp;#39;ve been brought out of a major depression because of this surgery.

My name&amp;#39;s Fabian Rastorfer and I&amp;#39;m the founder of Fabraz, a small video game company based in New York. We&amp;#39;re behind the following games: Cannon Crasha, Planet Diver and Slime-san!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a fan of video games my entire life. Both as a consumer and creator of them! Already as a kid I started playing around with game development by experimenting with RPG Maker XP and creating terrible Pokemon clones using Ruby. I&amp;#39;ve always considered video games as the ultimate medium combining all media! It incorporates it all: Visuals, sound, narrative, interactivity...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved from Switzerland to New York to study Design &amp;amp; Technology at Parsons and that&amp;#39;s when I started looking into making games professionally. I teamed up with fellow game developer Markus Jost online and released Cannon Crasha as an iOs application while still in college. It was a strategy game about two opposing castles trying to destroy each other with comically large cannons. It did quite well, being featured by Apple as a &amp;quot;...sure fire winner!&amp;quot; and being included in features like &amp;quot;Best Tower Defense Game&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was all the proof I needed and right after graduation I started my own company with my good friends and college colleagues Ben Miller and Edgar Castro. We got ourselves a tiny workspace in Manhattan and started feverishly working on Planet Diver, our first multi-platform title for mobile and Steam. It was about a daredevil who ventures from planet to planet to wingsuit dive in the most dangerous, alien caverns. It was nominated for the Momocon Indie Awards, the Indieprize and was bundled in with the Indiebox. This game, in turn, did well enough to fund our next project: Slime-san!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We started approaching Slime-san quite differently, being very open and public about it during development. I posted gifs of the game almost every day and we attended numerous conventions including Gamescom, Pax, GDC and more. This has also been our largest game to date and we even managed to partner up with Headup Games as our publisher. We also collaborated with more talent than ever before for this one! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is about a little slime that gets eaten by a giant worm and your goal is to platform yourself out of its innards before getting digested. It was part of the Humble Monthly bundle and to date has over 100k game activations on Steam. We&amp;#39;re now working on the Switch, PS4 and Xbox One versions slated for release later this Summer! Console releases are a BIG first for us and we just moved into a slightly bigger office with the hopes of expanding the team very soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s somewhat a rarity to start a video game company right after graduation and we&amp;#39;re quite proud of being self-funded and sustaining for the past two years now. The industry today is REALLY tough and it&amp;#39;s hard to survive at all. It&amp;#39;s easy to get lost in the shuffle, considering how flooded with games digital stores have become. It&amp;#39;s tough seeing so many colleagues struggle to even get by...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why I figured I should do an AMA!

You NEVER \"voluntarily highside\" a bike -that's just an excuse usually from new riders when they \"had to lay 'er down to avoid this or that\". In reality, he just panicked and was unable to control the bike and use the brakes properly. Voluntarily crashing is NEVER a faster way to stop then using the brakes correctly  :/  \n\nSince he didn't collide with the car, he can't go after the lady's insurance. He COULD attempt to sue her, and try to prove her action caused him to crash. But then, the truth is- if he were a better rider, he would have been able to keep the bike under control. So the counter argument would be: HE was unqualified to react to the situation, and should not be riding a bike he's not fully in control of. \n\nIt would have been better to just use the brakes to the maximum- even if that means he would hit the car (at a significantly slower speed then when he highsided) because then her action would have forced him to \"slam on the brakes\" and it cause him to hit her.  \"What else could he have done?\" (would be the argument) He applied the full brakes and because she cut in front of him too closely, the stopping distance of the motorcycle with full brakes applied was too great to avoid the crash. \n\nAt 35mph, a good rider can stop a a bike like that with dual ~310mm discs in about 25-30 feet and 2.5 seconds. \n\nI guarantee he used the rear brake wrong, locked the rear wheel, steered while skidding, and that caused the highside. How else could a highside occur in a straight line?!\n\nThe correct braking for maximum stopping power in a straight line is to feel the front brake pads initial bite on the discs, and squeeze smoothly and progressively harder and harder (we're talking fraction of a second time-wise) until the rear end goes light and is just starting to come up. That's the absolute fastest way to stop. And bikes have been able to achieve this for decades now. \n \nA rider that deals with traffic must be ready and *able* to react to changing conditions in a split second-and that includes gaining the skills to emergency stop from all speeds the rider rides at.

De Beers own most of the diamond mines throughout the world (most of them are in Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa). By owning the mines, they own a monopoly over the diamond market. The misconception is that they continue to mine diamonds and have them sitting away in storage, waiting for the current ones to sell. In actuality, they just stop mining if there is a surplus of diamonds on the market. Similar to how oil companies close down some of their mines when oil prices start to drop.\n\nAnother reason that diamonds are so expensive is because of the way they've been marketed since the 1920s. They created a demand through marketing, and have a control of the supply.\n\nJoke answer: I think it's super awesome.

Bunnies (and small rodents) need to chew for their dental health! It is a normal, necessary habit. In many cases, rabbits that haven't been spayed or neutered chew more, but ALL rabbits chew. You should not discipline a rabbit for chewing. If your rabbit's \"bunstruction\" projects are getting out of hand, it probably means that they do not have enough interesting items to chew, so they are beginning to chew modelings, door frames, etc. Give your rabbits their body weight in timothy hay every day, as well as other items they can safely chew, such as  timothy hay toys, heat-sealed cardboard boxes (i.e. boxes with no tape on them), and bunny-safe wood. If you give them enough interesting items to chew, they will chew less on items that you don't want them to chew. \n\nSecond, the \"my rabbit struggles when I pick him/her up\" issue. This is also a natural behavior, and it stems from instinct. In the wild, rabbits are prey items, which means if they are getting picked up, it is by a bird like a hawk that is going to eat them! Your bunny doesn't know that you are not trying to eat them. The best thing to do is spend lots of time with your bunny every single day, so they learn that you are a friend, not a predator. Pick them up and hold them on your lap on the couch or even have them sit beside yo. Brush them, talk to them, and even give them a little treat (in moderation). Over time, they will begin to realize that you are not trying to eat them.\n\nOh and the other thing that many people do not know about bunnies is that they will live longer lives (on average) if you get them spayed or neutered. Female bunnies especially often die from ovarian cancer. If you've ever owned a female bunny that was perfectly fine one day and dead the next, the first culprit we would suspect is ovarian cancer. This risk is eliminated when they are spayed!

From there you can branch out and start learning about paid traffic, driving traffic via social media, etc.\n\nThere are plenty of resources (paid and unpaid) out there.

It would be a much better use of your time to start and fail quickly, and learn from your mistakes than to build a mountain of content for a niche/product that no one wants, or is not viable.\n\nThe only skill that is an absolute requirement is being able to drive traffic to your site. If you learn this, everything else will fall into place. There is no better test of an idea, niche or product than seeing how real, targeted customers respond to what you're offering.\n\nThe skills you should focus on are social media marketing (FB + Instagram), FB ads, Google Adwords, and shoutouts.

Some studies seem to indicate that the problems are not as some state, as most people that use them for pain do not abuse them and as you seem to say above that it isn't all that difficult to spot potential problem patients. I've been using opioids for about 35 years and have honestly never been \"high\" from them. When I read about the amounts that are used by recreational users I am just blown away, I can't imagine taking that much as a dose. I have been off of them at various times for periods  longer than a month and had no desire to find them through no-legit channels, no desire to take more than I need to reduce the pain and no desire to see what taking more might do (I live in OR, if I want to get high I can just go buy some weed legally). I'm using them to primarily put off having pretty major surgery in the hopes that that surgery technology will improve as time goes on...something my current Doctors agree with but at the same time it has become a pain in the ass to the Doctors trying to do a good job and to me as a patient to get it. I feel that we seem to be using a sledge hammer to try to help a problem that has far more many causes that what is too often stated. Do you find a correlation in areas with high opioid miss-use to also have low levels of income, little opportunity toward good jobs with good pay, low education levels and historically a high use of miss-use of drugs or alcohol and mental health issues...and frequently in areas that were not great areas to live in for various reasons but in the past ten or twenty years the old primary employers have either folded up and closed doors or reduced the numbers of workers as well as the working conditions? Until we change those issues there will always be people looking for a way (no matter how bad or self destructive in the long run) to feel better, to ease the pain of life more so than an actual physical pain?\n\nAs an aside more than one doctor has told me that he has been told by patients that using opioids and weed together increase the pain relief, reduce the needed amount of opioids but he isn't supposed to tell me and of course he is supposed to quit writing scrips for a weed user.

BOB is very near and dear to my heart. I will totally destroy my sci fi geek cred right now and admit I haven't read much Asimov - I've read a bunch of the I,Robot stories and the first Foundation book but that's pretty much it. \n\nThe idea for BOB came from a bunch of different places. I was fascinated by the public debate over the NSA when everything with Snowden came to light, and as a writer, I was really intrigued by the idea of what it would be like to know that much about everyone - to know so many people so intimately, and through this veil of secrecy. I wanted to kind of explore what that kind of knowledge would do to a person. Not so much \"what is it like to work at the NSA,\" but literally \"What would it be like to BE the NSA?\" I also remember reading about the big data storage problem the NSA was having from collecting all of our data - the idea of this massive, endless server farm full of the mundane details of our quiet lives of desperation really stuck in my brain. \n\nAt the same time, I was also reading a bunch of articles about lab grown meat, artificially grown brain cells, and the ability to store information in DNA. The idea of an organic computer made of human flesh is so gross and nightmarish, but kind of tragic at the same time. \n\nSo putting those two things together - the NSA and this big meat computer, I had the basic idea: this gigantic brain lurking at the heart of the NSA, who's miserable and depressed because he's burdened by the knowledge of all our unhappiness - our depressing text messages, our late night pizza orders for one, that kind of thing. \n\nBut I still didn't really know what to do with the story until I saw this Twilight Zone episode called \"Night of the Meek\". In the episode, an alcoholic mall store Santa gets a magic bag of toys that lets him give people exactly what they want for Christmas. He's able to spread all this love and cheer and literally become Santa Clause for the night. It's beautiful. \n\nAnd that was the missing ingredient for BOB - all this hideous, superintelligent sad sack blob of meat wants is to be able to act out of compassion and give love and happiness, and he gets to do that by becoming Santa Claus as his dying wish. I love a story with a good challenge to it - can we get the audience to watch this monstrous blob become Santa and not only accept that, but cry? - so that became the magnetic north that lead us through the writing of the episode.\n\nANYWAY.

Was recording Jennifer Love Hewitt and we had to replace her saying the word 'shit'.  The director, producer, her and myself were all thinking of an alt word because nothing looked correct.

It's a raunchy movie that had almost 300 curse words.  They knew it filming, it was in the script and it was always the intention to be a hard R movie.  Well when the final edit was done and they were showing potential buyers/distributers, no one liked the fact that it was an R and would only buy a pg-13.

You have to know about the company and the job in order to demonstrate how your skills fit. I recommend, above all, applying for organizations whose values align with yours, because if an employer feels you \"fit\" well, you can convince them you're worth getting training on the stuff you don't know as well. Get to know the role well by asking around (informational interviews, LinkedIn, etc) so that you know what they need and how you can fill that need.\n\nWays a new grad can further contact at a company:\nLarge companies especially have automated any entry to job seekers, so it's easy to feel like you're lost in the job seekers' cyberspace. Again, I recommend informational interviews. You can reach out to someone via LinkedIn, or find their email from their company website, and explain that you're interested in their own career path. Invite them for coffee, or to meet in their office for 30 minutes. Make that interview about them, not you. Learn about their job and ask who they can refer you to.

First, job seekers should supplement their online search with personal connections. Any large company will only take applications online, so there is really no way out of that. However, if you make an effort to find people who work at your companies of interest, and ask for informational interviews, they can put in a good word when you do click \"submit\" online.
