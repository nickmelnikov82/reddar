Before arriving at university I used the 5-day JR pass to go to Hakodate, back to Tokyo, and many places in between.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to move to Kyoto in February of 2011, which was horrible timing... I experienced the March 2011 earthquake while in job training in the 11th floor of a high rise building, long story short it wasn&amp;#39;t fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been working for the same eikaiwa (English conversation school) since then, but I also work for a university, teach private classes, and have worked for dispatch services to companies, kindergartens, and even fitness centers. In 2016, I joined the General Union of Kansai.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was enrolled in a Japanese language school for about a year and a half, taking morning classes while I worked in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did my masters at the Graduate School of International Relations at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got married to my wonderful wife in 2015, and we now live in a 2LDK &amp;quot;mansion&amp;quot; in Yamashina ward with our gorgeous puppy &amp;quot;Eve-chan&amp;quot;. (You can see pictures on my wife&amp;#39;s Instagram: &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/eve_theminidachshund/\"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/eve_theminidachshund/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have also been hit by a car and required surgery since moving here, so I have experience in dealing with the Japanese healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never been arrested, but have had a few run ins with the police that are interesting stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been living and working in the Kansai area for the past 6+ years. During that time I have traveled pretty extensively all over Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some sightseeing highlights:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did an eight-day &amp;quot;men tour&amp;quot; (play on words because &amp;quot;men&amp;quot; is Japanese for noodle, and we were two men sightseeing) with a buddy from university where we sampled local noodle shops that specialized in their area&amp;#39;s type of noodle dish. We started in Kyoto, but made stops in Hiroshima, Miyajima, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Iwakuni, Kurashiki, Himeji, and Kakogawa. We used the &amp;quot;seishun-18-kippu&amp;quot; during that trip (not sure what that is? Ask ~_^ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took a trip to Hokkaido where I went to the Sapporo Beer brewery and museum (beer fairies!!), Furano lavender fields, a Cheese/Ice Cream/ Pizza &amp;quot;factory&amp;quot;, and other places in that area. Traveled there by &amp;quot;Low Cost Carrier&amp;quot; Peach airlines, and returned by Twighlight Express, which Japan Railways has since retired (although a renewal seems to be in the works).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Went to Shikoku for the Awa Odori in Tokushima, but went to a bunch of places on that island as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stayed in Okinawa when there was a typhoon, and rented a car for a day and drove from the Southern most point to the Norther most point of the main island and back to my hotel in less than 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask me anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof : &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/F0OGC\"&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/F0OGC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "time": 1493109608.0, "title": "IamA New Yorker working for one of \"the big two\" eikaiwas in Japan.

We are packing things up. I believe we actually successfully answered almost every single question between me and Danny!  Sorry if we missed yours! Thank you all for the support and for throwing some light on the game. We will do our best to support the game in every way we can and live up to your expectations! We&amp;#39;re out, thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello. My name is Charles Webb. Three years ago, while working IT for a small software company and binge playing Samurai-Gunn with my closest friends in much of my off time, I started working with one of them (Daniel Crockenberg.) Inspired by the wonderfully crafted combat mechanics of Samurai Gunn, we set out to make a punchy, fast paced dungeon-crawler with the depth and complexity of a fighting game!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time the community around the game grew enthusiastic enough that we decided we had to take the chance. We quit our jobs and began working on it full time. (Note: This is certainly usually a very bad idea!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to call the game &amp;#39;Ruin of the Reckless&amp;#39;, mostly as a reference to our sorry financial situation and the foolishness of our decision to make it. Hehe, get it!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About two years later, we planned and launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to complete the game &amp;#39;for real.&amp;#39; It was successful, largely due to the strength of our playable &amp;#39;Backers Only&amp;#39; Build, which became popular with streamers like Tietuesday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: We&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot of questions about this whole thing specifically so I want to put this in OP for more clarity...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, there is a slight lack of clarity in my post here.\nWe worked on the game for about 2 years part-time BEFORE the Kickstarter. After the Kickstarter we worked for about 7 months before the game was released. ALL of our living expenses were paid out of our own finances/savings, Kickstarter money was only spent on game assets, contractor fees, etc...\nWe certainly didn&amp;#39;t live for that entire time without any income!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then it has been non-stop work up to today putting the game together for our backers and the community at large. Over the course of development we have been through Steam Greenlight, conducted a successful Kickstarter campaign, been featured on several popular streams and youtube channels (including Tietuesday, DreadedCone, and TotalBiscuits wildly popular Co-Optional Podcast), met with major publishers, built a humble following of almost 2000 indie die-hards on twitter, signed on to and maintained contracts with almost 20 artists and musicians, been featured on many indie-gaming and videogaming news sites including Co-Optimus and well, a LOT of other stuff! It has really been quite a ride to get to this point!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also very proud and excited to say that we were recently accepted by GOG.com and will be included in to their curated store. To me this is a great honor and a validation of all of the hard work we have put in so far!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On release day we were featured on the front page of gog.com as well as the front page of the itch.io store. It remains to be seen whether we can crack the top sellers list on Steam but i&amp;#39;m crossing my fingers! We spent the first day on and near the top of the popular new releases page on Steam so release has gone well so far!

He started at NSA with little programming experience, but he quickly learned over his 11 years there, obtaining a Master&amp;#39;s in Computer Science at the &lt;a href=\"https://ep.jhu.edu/\"&gt;Hopkins night school&lt;/a&gt;.

After graduation, he went to work for the NSA as an applied research mathematician.  He spent 10 years doing cryptanalysis of things.

There is so much to say about this wonderful man, but this quick bio will have to do. \n\u201cMr. Berisford \u201cShep\u201d Shepherd is an arranger, composer, drummer, trombonist, contractor, and\nsinger. Born in Honduras in 1917, and raised in Philadelphia, he attended Jules E. Mastbaum Area\nConservatory and Vocational School where he was being groomed to play percussion in the\nPhiladelphia Orchestra. Shep served four years in the army composing, arranging, conducting,\nand playing trombone. After his service, he settled in New York City where he played and\ncontracted for Broadway shows. Shep has performed and written for seminal figures such as\nBenny Carter, Cy Oliver, Artie Shaw, Patti Page, Lionel Hampton, and Lena Horne among\nothers. Because of the high-demand for his arrangements, the catchphrase \u201cGet Shep\u201d became\ncommon among New York musicians. He toured with various Broadway shows while based in\nNew York. One of these shows led to San Francisco, where he eventually settled and was the\nhouse drummer at Finocchio\u2019s for 23 years. Shep moved down to South Orange County in 2007\nwhere he met his wife, Joy. She and Shep currently reside in San Clemente, California\u201d\nHere\u2019s a &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkT3saLNNig\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of him singing at 99 years old.\nHe\u2019s got a &lt;a href=\"https://www.saddleback.edu/news/arts/saddleback-big-band-shep-shepherd\"&gt;concert&lt;/a&gt; this Friday singing with the Saddleback College Big Band in Mission Viejo, CA. \nAsk him anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/Tl7QviX\"&gt;proof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Shep is going to rehearse with the band, but he will be back to answer more questions!

In that case, the full Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said that discriminating against someone because they are lesbian, gay or bisexual is a form of sex discrimination, and it is against the law. (Four circuits have already held that discriminating against transgender people is sex discrimination.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we are most certainly not going back! Right now, we\u2019re busy fighting &lt;a href=\"http://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20170426_trumps-1000-cuts\"&gt;against a hostile Trump Administration&lt;/a&gt;, fighting the so-called \u201cbathroom bills\u201d mushrooming all over the country; defending the Affordable Care Act, which is the most successful AIDS-fighting program in American history; fighting employment discrimination; and challenging fringe religious groups that want carve-outs to laws that protect everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wherever LGBTQ rights are at stake, we\u2019re on the case\u2026 so ask me anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/h5JdK\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/h5JdK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;re all done!

I&amp;#39;m 17 and from the Northwestern U.S, and had my gastric sleeve done last year in June. I flew down to Mexico to get my surgery done because of medical costs, as well as the possibility that I may have been denied surgery in the U.S. currently I&amp;#39;m at 280lbs, I work out 2-3 times a week and have toned my diet down miles below what I was eating last year. At my heaviest I was nearly 400lbs. After my surgery prep diet I weighed 364lbs, while I was in Mexico. I&amp;#39;ve lost almost 3 shirt sizes as well as 5 pants sizes since this surgery. As a 16 year old I decided to change my life with this surgery, and I can&amp;#39;t imagine having done anything different regardless of my situation. To clarify, this was the end all be all. I&amp;#39;ve done diets and exercise programs in the past and have had little success, and have gained more weight from trying. I&amp;#39;ve also had several personal trainers, who were extremely nice and helpful but unable to alleviate any problems I&amp;#39;ve had with my weight. I&amp;#39;ve been morbidly obese since I was 10 months old, and the general concensus is that my weight is mostly due to genetics (although I do accept the consequences and recognize that in the past my eating habits were atrocious) within my family, as well as complications with my mother&amp;#39;s pregnancy. This journey so far has been incredible, and I&amp;#39;ve been brought out of a major depression because of this surgery.

My name&amp;#39;s Fabian Rastorfer and I&amp;#39;m the founder of Fabraz, a small video game company based in New York. We&amp;#39;re behind the following games: Cannon Crasha, Planet Diver and Slime-san!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a fan of video games my entire life. Both as a consumer and creator of them! Already as a kid I started playing around with game development by experimenting with RPG Maker XP and creating terrible Pokemon clones using Ruby. I&amp;#39;ve always considered video games as the ultimate medium combining all media! It incorporates it all: Visuals, sound, narrative, interactivity...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved from Switzerland to New York to study Design &amp;amp; Technology at Parsons and that&amp;#39;s when I started looking into making games professionally. I teamed up with fellow game developer Markus Jost online and released Cannon Crasha as an iOs application while still in college. It was a strategy game about two opposing castles trying to destroy each other with comically large cannons. It did quite well, being featured by Apple as a &amp;quot;...sure fire winner!&amp;quot; and being included in features like &amp;quot;Best Tower Defense Game&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was all the proof I needed and right after graduation I started my own company with my good friends and college colleagues Ben Miller and Edgar Castro. We got ourselves a tiny workspace in Manhattan and started feverishly working on Planet Diver, our first multi-platform title for mobile and Steam. It was about a daredevil who ventures from planet to planet to wingsuit dive in the most dangerous, alien caverns. It was nominated for the Momocon Indie Awards, the Indieprize and was bundled in with the Indiebox. This game, in turn, did well enough to fund our next project: Slime-san!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We started approaching Slime-san quite differently, being very open and public about it during development. I posted gifs of the game almost every day and we attended numerous conventions including Gamescom, Pax, GDC and more. This has also been our largest game to date and we even managed to partner up with Headup Games as our publisher. We also collaborated with more talent than ever before for this one! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is about a little slime that gets eaten by a giant worm and your goal is to platform yourself out of its innards before getting digested. It was part of the Humble Monthly bundle and to date has over 100k game activations on Steam. We&amp;#39;re now working on the Switch, PS4 and Xbox One versions slated for release later this Summer! Console releases are a BIG first for us and we just moved into a slightly bigger office with the hopes of expanding the team very soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s somewhat a rarity to start a video game company right after graduation and we&amp;#39;re quite proud of being self-funded and sustaining for the past two years now. The industry today is REALLY tough and it&amp;#39;s hard to survive at all. It&amp;#39;s easy to get lost in the shuffle, considering how flooded with games digital stores have become. It&amp;#39;s tough seeing so many colleagues struggle to even get by...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why I figured I should do an AMA!
