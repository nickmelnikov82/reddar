(The other parts are not too valuable, I'm not sure what happens to them)\n\nI know some of the bigger plants are in Germany and Japan.\n\nUsually a local aggregator will shred and bale it for efficient shipping and send it off to be smelted back into usable products.\n\n2) Does it wind up back in Australia?\n\nThe finished product is sold to the highest bidder regardless of location.\n\n3) What percentage is recycled?\n\nDepends on the methods, recycler, and the amount of money invested. I'm not familiar with this end of the process.\n\n4) Can loads be contaminated and therefor disposed of?\n\nNot qualified to answer\n\n5) Why don't you get paid for it? \n\nRecycling household waste is NOT a profitable venture (for most materials), the amount of labor, machinery, and energy required to turn it back into a finished product often costs more than it yields.\n\nThey make money by charging consumers, businesses, and municipalities money to do the work. People pay for it because of the impact they feel it has on the environment.\n\nHere are some examples for electronics that are worth something. These are the prices the recycler will get from an aggregator. They will pay a consumer half that. Unless you have a full truck load of material. They need to make tens of thousands of dollars every day. They don't care about buying 50-100lbs of this stuff:\n\n(Pricing in USD)\nComputer memory $14~$17 /lb\nComputer processors $2~$4\nComputer hard drives $0.75 /lb\nCircuit boards $0.75 ~ $3.75 /lb\n\nI think steel and aluminum are in the range of $0.05 /lb ish.\nAnd plastic and glass are less than that I would think.\n\nSo if you recycle 40 lbs of plastic, glass, and aluminum, we are talking about $2.50 in resale value maybe?\n\nNow think of the cost of the two guys in the truck to pick it up, the diesel to run it, the maintenance, the lease payments on the truck. The labor at the processing facility, the lease payments on the building and equipment, the cost to ship it, the insurance, workmanscomp, the costs to run a recycling business are quite extensive.\n\nAs an aside, it's more efficient to recycle aluminum than to mine and refine it. It is one of the few household items that is easier to reclaim than mine (or so I've heard).\n\nSource: Personal opinion, but I work in used computer recovery and work with some recycling facets on the side.", "depth": 0, "id": "dgze3l4", "parent": "68kyvk", "score": 12, "time": 1493642875.0, "ups": 12}, {"author": "starryhero", "body": "As a person who has worked in a hospital with lots of waste, I would love to hear if my extra walk to the recycling bin was worth it.

Here in California most of the material will be shipped overseas. \n\n2) Some of the material will make its way back to California because we have certain laws regarding the percent of recycled content in certain products. \n\n3) Recycling rates vary by facility and location and types of materials accepted.

I experienced the March 2011 earthquake while in job training in the 11th floor of a high rise building, long story short it wasn&amp;#39;t fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been working for the same eikaiwa (English conversation school) since then, but I also work for a university, teach private classes, and have worked for dispatch services to companies, kindergartens, and even fitness centers. In 2016, I joined the General Union of Kansai.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was enrolled in a Japanese language school for about a year and a half, taking morning classes while I worked in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did my masters at the Graduate School of International Relations at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got married to my wonderful wife in 2015, and we now live in a 2LDK &amp;quot;mansion&amp;quot; in Yamashina ward with our gorgeous puppy &amp;quot;Eve-chan&amp;quot;.

We started in Kyoto, but made stops in Hiroshima, Miyajima, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Iwakuni, Kurashiki, Himeji, and Kakogawa. We used the &amp;quot;seishun-18-kippu&amp;quot; during that trip (not sure what that is? Ask ~_^ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took a trip to Hokkaido where I went to the Sapporo Beer brewery and museum (beer fairies!!), Furano lavender fields, a Cheese/Ice Cream/ Pizza &amp;quot;factory&amp;quot;, and other places in that area. Traveled there by &amp;quot;Low Cost Carrier&amp;quot; Peach airlines, and returned by Twighlight Express, which Japan Railways has since retired (although a renewal seems to be in the works).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Went to Shikoku for the Awa Odori in Tokushima, but went to a bunch of places on that island as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stayed in Okinawa when there was a typhoon, and rented a car for a day and drove from the Southern most point to the Norther most point of the main island and back to my hotel in less than 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask me anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof : &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/F0OGC\"&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/F0OGC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "time": 1493109608.0, "title": "IamA New Yorker working for one of \"the big two\" eikaiwas in Japan.

Googled it and it turns out that the repair guys were actually Kirby vacuum salesmen, who would break people's vacuums (nullifying the warranty as it had been tampered with by a non dyson-registered repairman) and then refuse to leave until people bought a \u00a31000+ Kirby vacuum from them, they were notorious for sticking around and threatening people until the police were on their way.

It meant the world, and I never got to thank him properly. \n\n\nI was waiting by his bus after a show in Reno, along with a couple dozen other fans, hoping to get an autograph. I had recently taken up guitar, and wanted to try to get autographs from some of my musical heroes on the guitar. When he stepped off the bus, he was happily scrawling his his name or various items fans had brought. CDs, bandanas from the merch booth, etc. His autograph was basically a recognizable \"W\" with a scribble afterwards; Nearly illegible. When my time to meet Willie came around, I handed him my guitar. He looked around at the handful of fans still waiting to meet him, then knocked on the door of his tour bus. When the door opened, he asked me to step in, and told me that he would be in shortly. \n\n\nI was a little nervous on the bus, as there were several other people on there, none of which I knew. I recognized one or two band members, but that was it. I sat and made small talk with one of the band members for a few minutes until Willie returned. When he came back, he sat down next to me and announced for everyone on the bus to gather around, as I was going to perform a song for them. I was already nervous enough, but now my anxiety was through the roof. I shakily explained that I had just recently started playing guitar, and that I didn't think anyone would want to hear anything that I knew how to play. Everybody had a good laugh at that. Willie knew that I was just looking for an autograph, and asked me to take the guitar out of its case and let him see it. He plucked a few strings, made an adjustment or two to the tuning, and played/sang a few bars of a song that I did not recognize. He then sat the guitar down and said \"Look, I'd love to sign this for you, but I just want to know something. What are you going to do with it? Are you going to put it up on eBay and make a few bucks? Are you going to hide it away in your closet and just bring it out when you want to tell your friends about the time you got to meet Willie Nelson? Or are you going to play it? This is a nice guitar, and I don't think that the guys over at Fender spent time making it just so it can sit in a closet collecting dust. If you can promise me you're gonna play it, I'll be happy to sign my name.\" I promised him that I would, and he took the silver paint marker a very clearly and legibly signed his name and the date. He signed just above the bridge, explaining that it would be less likely to be rubbed off in that location.\n\n\nIn the following years, I was lucky enough to meet Waylon and Merle Haggard, both of whom added their signature to my guitar, though neither took the care or time that Willie did.\n\n\nWillie, if you end up seeing this, I just want you to know that I've kept my word.

The problems begin with the very first word \"Lets\". For this usage one should use the contraction for \"Let us\" written \"Let's\". There is indeed a spelling of lets with no apostrophe. It is for this usage: \"The window lets the sun in. Leave it closed, please.\" \n\nDon't believe me? Take the first clause: \"Lets have some fun with Machine Learning and become the expert...\"\n\nWe have talked about the first word, already.  Moving on, one must ask, Why is \"Machine Learning\" capitalized? Is it a company. A place? No, it is a common noun and not a proper noun. Random capitalization for emphasis went out of style in the 19th century. Want more from the first sentence? The word \"expert\" should be plural as written since the subject \"Let's\" is a contraction that contains a plural. SO the first clause should read as follows: \"Let's have some fun with machine learning and become the experts....\" \n\nI hope I made my point, guys.

Nothing like castaway though.   I live on an island near Savannah GA.  Tourist area.  There is a large uninhabited island just south of us.  The locals out here go camping over there a least a few times a year but it is normally during Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend, stuff like that just to get away from the tourists. I always have to work those weekends because I work on a deep sea fishing charter boat.  \n\nWell, I had a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday off so I loaded everything up and kayaked over to the island.  I figured I'd see at least 4 or 5 friends over there.  Nope. Not a soul.  I took all my gear off and took it up into the woods.   When I got back, the kayak had floated away from shore due to a passing boats wake.  (Rookie move, I know).  \n\nI ended up being there til Thursday by myself.  I was fine though.  I had brought enough water for the whole trip and I had plenty of fishing gear which kept me fed.  I was a smoker at that time and ran out of smokes though.  I guess that was the worst of it.  All in all, a pretty fun time.   \n\nAlso, I think if things had gotten really bad, I could have made a big fire and the coast guard would have come to check it out and if the tide was coming in, I probably could have swam back to the island in which I reside.  I hitched a ride on my buddy's skiff at the end.  \n\nTLDR:  went for a relaxing kayak trip to uninhabited island next to a tourist island. Lost kayak due to being an idiot.  Well fed.

I was 12 years old and it was spring break. My dad, myself, uncle, and 2 cousins were boating in the gulf of mexico. We were planning a camping trip so FORTUNATELY for hs we had gear, food, etc. this was the first time my dad and I had navigated ocean/ gulf waters (gulf if mexico) before. Well it was low tide, while on our way to another destination we were cruising at max speed when we suddenly came to what was almost an instant stop from bottoming oit on a sand bar. We had never experienced low tide while boating before... mistake #1. Now the tide was going oit, we werent realizing this at this point yet.  Boat hits the sandbar and I went flying off the front of it into the shallow seaweed sandbar... freked me the fuck oit because suddenly inwas in the water with slimy shit and was what looked like to me in the middle of the fucking ocean. I stand up and shake it off and my dad throws me a rope and asks if im okay. He has me and my uncle pull us into a cove that this island hooks around and creates, this was mistake #2. We had to replace the prop on the motor so before we did that (when hitting the sandbar we figured the prop digging into the sandbar busted the blades) we stopped to have linch on this island and stretch out legs and have lunch. We were off the boat for maybe an hour or two not paying attention... tide went out. Upon returning to the boat we see that where there was once water was sand and there is a boat sunk into the sand/swampy dirty mud shit muck. It hits us, the fucking tides went out. At this point the top of the boat now sits lower than sea level... we have to dig as fast as we can before the tides come back. Now at this time in my life my best friend and i whenever we went to the beach liked to dig holes... the sand was super soft and easy to dig, so i never wanted to use those shitty fucking plastic sets, i always wanted to bring my dads spade shovel. This was the first time my dad ever used the words \"fuckiing asshole\" to me because while I was digging with the plastic fucking shovels and my cousins with the little buckets, my dad with a boat oar and my uncle with his hands I said \" we should have brought the shovel i wanted to bring but you just had to say no\"... clearly i was being a little fucking asshole lol. \n\nNow we get the boat out of the dirt, tide begins to come in and were having to constantly dig and dig and dig as it slowly rushes back. Fast forward hours and the boat is back in the water. We have to wait until daylight to check anything further (oh yeah this happened in the evening late afternoon and into the night). We had left an anchor tied to a tree on this island and the boat in the cove where it was pretty mellow. Well the next morning we discovered some fucking raccoons we assumed got into the damn boat and ate EVERYTHING. Left 1 pack of orange capri sun, they didnt like it as much as i didnt\" because all of the cherry ones had puncture marks in them, and a ton of food packaging was sling aboit the boat. We had only 1 cooler of stuff left. I think it was like some backn, steaks, milk, water, and pancake mix. But def not enough for 5 people... i digress obvioisly we survive. We gonto fix the damn prop on the motor, except ahem... i didnt put it back. You see when we would go boating it was my job to take inventory and organize everything and make sure everything was clean and untangled. Well i took everything out of the seat box thingy and intangled it all in the garage and cleaned out the crap from under the seat. Well i didnt pit it back and while i was doing something else ignored my duties and i assume my cousin pit the lid back on the chair and it was forgotten aboit. We had no prop and cell phones werent what they are today. We had a radio and used it to call out but didnt get a response, oir radio wasnt anything special... it was loke some shitty radio my dad pulled oit of a mini van years before thatbwe stuck in the boat. After aboit 4 days we were able to flag another boat down... my dad was able to go back to land and get a prop and come back and we got it fixed. We spent the remainder of oir spring break there, my mom and sister joined us and it turned into a nive campomg trip.\n\n2. Island wasnt quite like the movies. It was pretty big, definitely would be cool to explore.... i would say dangerous tondo so in case snake biyes tho or spider bites.\n\n3. The island was a long island, at the tip id spun aroind unti a cove, thats where we got stuck. We placed oir tent where we found pine needles as we assumed the tide couldnt reach that point. It was a very beautiful spot. \n\n4. Stranded for like 3 or 4 days, stayed for a week.\n\n5. At first it was scarey but my dad always kept calm.

We are packing things up. I believe we actually successfully answered almost every single question between me and Danny!  Sorry if we missed yours! Thank you all for the support and for throwing some light on the game. We will do our best to support the game in every way we can and live up to your expectations! We&amp;#39;re out, thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello. My name is Charles Webb. Three years ago, while working IT for a small software company and binge playing Samurai-Gunn with my closest friends in much of my off time, I started working with one of them (Daniel Crockenberg.) Inspired by the wonderfully crafted combat mechanics of Samurai Gunn, we set out to make a punchy, fast paced dungeon-crawler with the depth and complexity of a fighting game!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time the community around the game grew enthusiastic enough that we decided we had to take the chance. We quit our jobs and began working on it full time. (Note: This is certainly usually a very bad idea!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to call the game &amp;#39;Ruin of the Reckless&amp;#39;, mostly as a reference to our sorry financial situation and the foolishness of our decision to make it. Hehe, get it!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About two years later, we planned and launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to complete the game &amp;#39;for real.&amp;#39; It was successful, largely due to the strength of our playable &amp;#39;Backers Only&amp;#39; Build, which became popular with streamers like Tietuesday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: We&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot of questions about this whole thing specifically so I want to put this in OP for more clarity...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, there is a slight lack of clarity in my post here.\nWe worked on the game for about 2 years part-time BEFORE the Kickstarter. After the Kickstarter we worked for about 7 months before the game was released. ALL of our living expenses were paid out of our own finances/savings, Kickstarter money was only spent on game assets, contractor fees, etc...\nWe certainly didn&amp;#39;t live for that entire time without any income!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then it has been non-stop work up to today putting the game together for our backers and the community at large. Over the course of development we have been through Steam Greenlight, conducted a successful Kickstarter campaign, been featured on several popular streams and youtube channels (including Tietuesday, DreadedCone, and TotalBiscuits wildly popular Co-Optional Podcast), met with major publishers, built a humble following of almost 2000 indie die-hards on twitter, signed on to and maintained contracts with almost 20 artists and musicians, been featured on many indie-gaming and videogaming news sites including Co-Optimus and well, a LOT of other stuff! It has really been quite a ride to get to this point!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also very proud and excited to say that we were recently accepted by GOG.com and will be included in to their curated store. To me this is a great honor and a validation of all of the hard work we have put in so far!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On release day we were featured on the front page of gog.com as well as the front page of the itch.io store. It remains to be seen whether we can crack the top sellers list on Steam but i&amp;#39;m crossing my fingers! We spent the first day on and near the top of the popular new releases page on Steam so release has gone well so far!

There is so much to say about this wonderful man, but this quick bio will have to do. \n\u201cMr. Berisford \u201cShep\u201d Shepherd is an arranger, composer, drummer, trombonist, contractor, and\nsinger. Born in Honduras in 1917, and raised in Philadelphia, he attended Jules E. Mastbaum Area\nConservatory and Vocational School where he was being groomed to play percussion in the\nPhiladelphia Orchestra. Shep served four years in the army composing, arranging, conducting,\nand playing trombone. After his service, he settled in New York City where he played and\ncontracted for Broadway shows. Shep has performed and written for seminal figures such as\nBenny Carter, Cy Oliver, Artie Shaw, Patti Page, Lionel Hampton, and Lena Horne among\nothers. Because of the high-demand for his arrangements, the catchphrase \u201cGet Shep\u201d became\ncommon among New York musicians. He toured with various Broadway shows while based in\nNew York. One of these shows led to San Francisco, where he eventually settled and was the\nhouse drummer at Finocchio\u2019s for 23 years. Shep moved down to South Orange County in 2007\nwhere he met his wife, Joy. She and Shep currently reside in San Clemente, California\u201d\nHere\u2019s a &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkT3saLNNig\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of him singing at 99 years old.\nHe\u2019s got a &lt;a href=\"https://www.saddleback.edu/news/arts/saddleback-big-band-shep-shepherd\"&gt;concert&lt;/a&gt; this Friday singing with the Saddleback College Big Band in Mission Viejo, CA. \nAsk him anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/Tl7QviX\"&gt;proof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Shep is going to rehearse with the band, but he will be back to answer more questions!

The 2 that are in \"battle\" now are 1st and 14th amendment. Freedom of Religion and Civil Rights. And I do believe for many years have played well together (I could be wrong about this one too, I am learning so please bear with me).\n\nI heard many audio and video's of many high officials talk about how the 1st Amendment is a fundamental right guaranteed to EVERY citizen in the US. Which begs me to ask the question. Who's beliefs?\n\nHomosexuality has always been a religious question. Which generates from the question \"Did God make gay people?\" and depending on the answer to this question, lies one deeply held religious conviction. However, it seems to me that those that believe that Homosexuality is a sin because God did not make LGBT. Is the only belief that is protected by the 1st amendment.\n\nLike myself, there are many LGBT individuals of faith out there that for years of self discovery. We have a \"belief\" (using the word belief for legal terms based on the Constitution) that God made us gay.\n\nWhy is it that one side is protected by they religious belief and the other is not?\n\nWhat about those that are LGBT atheist? They should be protect by the 1st amendment as well, correct? \n\nSo how are these Religious Freedom Bills, not violating the 1st amendment to began with? \n\nWhy are the LGBT not only protected by the 14 amendment but by the 1st amendment as well? \n\n", "depth": 0, "id": "dgtugua", "parent": "67w1ut", "score": 2, "time": 1493312585.0, "ups": 2}, {"author": "adithyaappu", "body": "How strong the influence of religions in denying equality for LGBT community?

The 1996 breakthrough &lt;a href=\"http://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20160520_romer-v-evans-at-20\"&gt;Romer&lt;/a&gt; case was the first time the Supreme Court said that gays and lesbians have the same right to seek government protection against discrimination as any other group of people. In 2003, we ended the &lt;a href=\"http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/lawrence-v-texas\"&gt;criminalization of LGBT lives by overturning state sodomy laws in Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month &lt;a href=\"http://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20170404_court-rules-employers-cant-discriminate-against-gay-employees\"&gt;we won a pivotal employment discrimination case on behalf of a lesbian who lost her job&lt;/a&gt; after someone saw her kissing her girlfriend goodbye in the parking lot. In that case, the full Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said that discriminating against someone because they are lesbian, gay or bisexual is a form of sex discrimination, and it is against the law. (Four circuits have already held that discriminating against transgender people is sex discrimination.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we are most certainly not going back!

This means full HD &amp; glorious 4K resolution, streamlined matchmaking, streaming, and an even wider audience of slayers to play with due to the pervasiveness of PC gaming.\n\nBeing free to play means that we\u2019ll also be able to add content (behemoths, weapons, story, quests, etc.) at a steady pace to keep the game fresh and exciting without needing to wait for a yearly release cycle. Free to play also means that people will be able to invite their friends to experience this genre without the risk. We hope this means the genre will only grow!\n\nAside from logistical elements, the islands that you explore in Dauntless are not segmented; they are one big, completely explorable map without loading zones. Working with a modern engine like Unreal also allows us to do some really crazy, exciting things with behemoths in terms of their abilities and scale.\n\nPhilosophically, we want to get players in and playing as quickly as possible. When we\u2019ve tried to introduce our friends to this genre in the past we often hear that needing to spend hours wading through gathering missions is discouraging. We want slayers fighting deadly, huge behemoths as quickly as possible and really keep the focus on slaying their way to the top.

Slayers who invest a lot of time into the game will find features like modifiers, challenges, and quests that inspire them to \u201crevisit\u201d every behemoth in the game.\n\nThe question inside your question is how do we keep every encounter challenging. Skill is a cornerstone of Dauntless \u2014 we want to push every slayer to their limits. And we don\u2019t want the thrill of that challenge to let up at any point during progression.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s also the social element.

I'm not really familiar with gastric sleeve so I could be totally ignorant here, but as far as I know, it essentially makes your stomach much smaller and thus forces you to eat small portions. Does it do anything else? It's  confusing to me because I don't understand why it wouldn't be possible to just eat those same smaller amounts without having the surgery.  Major life-changing surgery is not something people do because they just don't have the ability to stick to a small amount of food - you do it because you literally can't achieve results by a calorie limiting diet.  So I'm wondering, what are the physical reasons that dieting didn't work, but it does work now?  If you were morbidly obese as an infant I'd guess it was not because your parents fed you bottles of warm butter!  It was that eating normal amounts made you bigger than it should have.  So it seems like just eating fewer calories won't fix that problem, yet by restricting portion size via the surgery isn't that the idea?  \n\nI feel like I have to be totally wrong about one of these assumptions or it doesn't make sense, I just don't know which one.  If you were putting on lots of weight as a baby regardless of eating not that much, then the amount you eat didn't seem to be the problem at all.

I&amp;#39;m 17 and from the Northwestern U.S, and had my gastric sleeve done last year in June. I flew down to Mexico to get my surgery done because of medical costs, as well as the possibility that I may have been denied surgery in the U.S. currently I&amp;#39;m at 280lbs, I work out 2-3 times a week and have toned my diet down miles below what I was eating last year. At my heaviest I was nearly 400lbs. After my surgery prep diet I weighed 364lbs, while I was in Mexico. I&amp;#39;ve lost almost 3 shirt sizes as well as 5 pants sizes since this surgery. As a 16 year old I decided to change my life with this surgery, and I can&amp;#39;t imagine having done anything different regardless of my situation. To clarify, this was the end all be all. I&amp;#39;ve done diets and exercise programs in the past and have had little success, and have gained more weight from trying. I&amp;#39;ve also had several personal trainers, who were extremely nice and helpful but unable to alleviate any problems I&amp;#39;ve had with my weight. I&amp;#39;ve been morbidly obese since I was 10 months old, and the general concensus is that my weight is mostly due to genetics (although I do accept the consequences and recognize that in the past my eating habits were atrocious) within my family, as well as complications with my mother&amp;#39;s pregnancy. This journey so far has been incredible, and I&amp;#39;ve been brought out of a major depression because of this surgery.

My name&amp;#39;s Fabian Rastorfer and I&amp;#39;m the founder of Fabraz, a small video game company based in New York. We&amp;#39;re behind the following games: Cannon Crasha, Planet Diver and Slime-san!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a fan of video games my entire life. Both as a consumer and creator of them! Already as a kid I started playing around with game development by experimenting with RPG Maker XP and creating terrible Pokemon clones using Ruby. I&amp;#39;ve always considered video games as the ultimate medium combining all media! It incorporates it all: Visuals, sound, narrative, interactivity...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved from Switzerland to New York to study Design &amp;amp; Technology at Parsons and that&amp;#39;s when I started looking into making games professionally. I teamed up with fellow game developer Markus Jost online and released Cannon Crasha as an iOs application while still in college. It was a strategy game about two opposing castles trying to destroy each other with comically large cannons. It did quite well, being featured by Apple as a &amp;quot;...sure fire winner!&amp;quot; and being included in features like &amp;quot;Best Tower Defense Game&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was all the proof I needed and right after graduation I started my own company with my good friends and college colleagues Ben Miller and Edgar Castro. We got ourselves a tiny workspace in Manhattan and started feverishly working on Planet Diver, our first multi-platform title for mobile and Steam. It was about a daredevil who ventures from planet to planet to wingsuit dive in the most dangerous, alien caverns. It was nominated for the Momocon Indie Awards, the Indieprize and was bundled in with the Indiebox. This game, in turn, did well enough to fund our next project: Slime-san!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We started approaching Slime-san quite differently, being very open and public about it during development. I posted gifs of the game almost every day and we attended numerous conventions including Gamescom, Pax, GDC and more. This has also been our largest game to date and we even managed to partner up with Headup Games as our publisher. We also collaborated with more talent than ever before for this one! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is about a little slime that gets eaten by a giant worm and your goal is to platform yourself out of its innards before getting digested. It was part of the Humble Monthly bundle and to date has over 100k game activations on Steam. We&amp;#39;re now working on the Switch, PS4 and Xbox One versions slated for release later this Summer! Console releases are a BIG first for us and we just moved into a slightly bigger office with the hopes of expanding the team very soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s somewhat a rarity to start a video game company right after graduation and we&amp;#39;re quite proud of being self-funded and sustaining for the past two years now. The industry today is REALLY tough and it&amp;#39;s hard to survive at all. It&amp;#39;s easy to get lost in the shuffle, considering how flooded with games digital stores have become. It&amp;#39;s tough seeing so many colleagues struggle to even get by...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why I figured I should do an AMA!
