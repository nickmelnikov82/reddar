All in all, a pretty fun time.   \n\nAlso, I think if things had gotten really bad, I could have made a big fire and the coast guard would have come to check it out and if the tide was coming in, I probably could have swam back to the island in which I reside.

I was 12 years old and it was spring break. My dad, myself, uncle, and 2 cousins were boating in the gulf of mexico. We were planning a camping trip so FORTUNATELY for hs we had gear, food, etc. this was the first time my dad and I had navigated ocean/ gulf waters (gulf if mexico) before. Well it was low tide, while on our way to another destination we were cruising at max speed when we suddenly came to what was almost an instant stop from bottoming oit on a sand bar. We had never experienced low tide while boating before... mistake #1. Now the tide was going oit, we werent realizing this at this point yet.  Boat hits the sandbar and I went flying off the front of it into the shallow seaweed sandbar... freked me the fuck oit because suddenly inwas in the water with slimy shit and was what looked like to me in the middle of the fucking ocean. I stand up and shake it off and my dad throws me a rope and asks if im okay. He has me and my uncle pull us into a cove that this island hooks around and creates, this was mistake #2. We had to replace the prop on the motor so before we did that (when hitting the sandbar we figured the prop digging into the sandbar busted the blades) we stopped to have linch on this island and stretch out legs and have lunch. We were off the boat for maybe an hour or two not paying attention... tide went out. Upon returning to the boat we see that where there was once water was sand and there is a boat sunk into the sand/swampy dirty mud shit muck. It hits us, the fucking tides went out. At this point the top of the boat now sits lower than sea level... we have to dig as fast as we can before the tides come back. Now at this time in my life my best friend and i whenever we went to the beach liked to dig holes... the sand was super soft and easy to dig, so i never wanted to use those shitty fucking plastic sets, i always wanted to bring my dads spade shovel. This was the first time my dad ever used the words \"fuckiing asshole\" to me because while I was digging with the plastic fucking shovels and my cousins with the little buckets, my dad with a boat oar and my uncle with his hands I said \" we should have brought the shovel i wanted to bring but you just had to say no\"... clearly i was being a little fucking asshole lol. \n\nNow we get the boat out of the dirt, tide begins to come in and were having to constantly dig and dig and dig as it slowly rushes back. Fast forward hours and the boat is back in the water. We have to wait until daylight to check anything further (oh yeah this happened in the evening late afternoon and into the night). We had left an anchor tied to a tree on this island and the boat in the cove where it was pretty mellow. Well the next morning we discovered some fucking raccoons we assumed got into the damn boat and ate EVERYTHING. Left 1 pack of orange capri sun, they didnt like it as much as i didnt\" because all of the cherry ones had puncture marks in them, and a ton of food packaging was sling aboit the boat. We had only 1 cooler of stuff left. I think it was like some backn, steaks, milk, water, and pancake mix. But def not enough for 5 people... i digress obvioisly we survive. We gonto fix the damn prop on the motor, except ahem... i didnt put it back. You see when we would go boating it was my job to take inventory and organize everything and make sure everything was clean and untangled. Well i took everything out of the seat box thingy and intangled it all in the garage and cleaned out the crap from under the seat. Well i didnt pit it back and while i was doing something else ignored my duties and i assume my cousin pit the lid back on the chair and it was forgotten aboit. We had no prop and cell phones werent what they are today. We had a radio and used it to call out but didnt get a response, oir radio wasnt anything special... it was loke some shitty radio my dad pulled oit of a mini van years before thatbwe stuck in the boat. After aboit 4 days we were able to flag another boat down... my dad was able to go back to land and get a prop and come back and we got it fixed. We spent the remainder of oir spring break there, my mom and sister joined us and it turned into a nive campomg trip.\n\n2. Island wasnt quite like the movies. It was pretty big, definitely would be cool to explore.... i would say dangerous tondo so in case snake biyes tho or spider bites.\n\n3. The island was a long island, at the tip id spun aroind unti a cove, thats where we got stuck. We placed oir tent where we found pine needles as we assumed the tide couldnt reach that point. It was a very beautiful spot. \n\n4. Stranded for like 3 or 4 days, stayed for a week.\n\n5. At first it was scarey but my dad always kept calm.

Free to play also means that people will be able to invite their friends to experience this genre without the risk. We hope this means the genre will only grow!\n\nAside from logistical elements, the islands that you explore in Dauntless are not segmented; they are one big, completely explorable map without loading zones.

When we\u2019ve tried to introduce our friends to this genre in the past we often hear that needing to spend hours wading through gathering missions is discouraging.

I'm not really familiar with gastric sleeve so I could be totally ignorant here, but as far as I know, it essentially makes your stomach much smaller and thus forces you to eat small portions. Does it do anything else? It's  confusing to me because I don't understand why it wouldn't be possible to just eat those same smaller amounts without having the surgery.  Major life-changing surgery is not something people do because they just don't have the ability to stick to a small amount of food - you do it because you literally can't achieve results by a calorie limiting diet.  So I'm wondering, what are the physical reasons that dieting didn't work, but it does work now?  If you were morbidly obese as an infant I'd guess it was not because your parents fed you bottles of warm butter!  It was that eating normal amounts made you bigger than it should have.  So it seems like just eating fewer calories won't fix that problem, yet by restricting portion size via the surgery isn't that the idea?  \n\nI feel like I have to be totally wrong about one of these assumptions or it doesn't make sense, I just don't know which one.  If you were putting on lots of weight as a baby regardless of eating not that much, then the amount you eat didn't seem to be the problem at all.

The problems begin with the very first word \"Lets\". For this usage one should use the contraction for \"Let us\" written \"Let's\". There is indeed a spelling of lets with no apostrophe. It is for this usage: \"The window lets the sun in. Leave it closed, please.\" \n\nDon't believe me? Take the first clause: \"Lets have some fun with Machine Learning and become the expert...\"\n\nWe have talked about the first word, already.  Moving on, one must ask, Why is \"Machine Learning\" capitalized? Is it a company. A place? No, it is a common noun and not a proper noun. Random capitalization for emphasis went out of style in the 19th century. Want more from the first sentence? The word \"expert\" should be plural as written since the subject \"Let's\" is a contraction that contains a plural. SO the first clause should read as follows: \"Let's have some fun with machine learning and become the experts....\" \n\nI hope I made my point, guys.

If we had to ADR, we would prefer to hire the original actor (most actor contracts had some provision for this) but quite often they will be on to other projects and unavailable and we would have to do our best to match their voice with another actor. \n\nI personally don't know any voice talent that does this and nothing else, many belong to \"loop groups\" that do everything from replacing lines to background crowd noise. \n\nWe (the production company) were responsible for delivering to the network a product suitable to air and we would try to keep the essence of what is being said as true to the original material as possible. Usually it was just myself and my sound designer coming up with replacement lines and we would tend to err on the side of caution if there was any question whether or not something would be acceptable.\n\nAnd the most ridiculous changes to a film I've ever seen was the first TV edit of \"Cheech and Chong's Next Movie\".

Googled it and it turns out that the repair guys were actually Kirby vacuum salesmen, who would break people's vacuums (nullifying the warranty as it had been tampered with by a non dyson-registered repairman) and then refuse to leave until people bought a \u00a31000+ Kirby vacuum from them, they were notorious for sticking around and threatening people until the police were on their way.

It meant the world, and I never got to thank him properly. \n\n\nI was waiting by his bus after a show in Reno, along with a couple dozen other fans, hoping to get an autograph. I had recently taken up guitar, and wanted to try to get autographs from some of my musical heroes on the guitar. When he stepped off the bus, he was happily scrawling his his name or various items fans had brought. CDs, bandanas from the merch booth, etc. His autograph was basically a recognizable \"W\" with a scribble afterwards; Nearly illegible. When my time to meet Willie came around, I handed him my guitar. He looked around at the handful of fans still waiting to meet him, then knocked on the door of his tour bus. When the door opened, he asked me to step in, and told me that he would be in shortly. \n\n\nI was a little nervous on the bus, as there were several other people on there, none of which I knew. I recognized one or two band members, but that was it. I sat and made small talk with one of the band members for a few minutes until Willie returned. When he came back, he sat down next to me and announced for everyone on the bus to gather around, as I was going to perform a song for them. I was already nervous enough, but now my anxiety was through the roof. I shakily explained that I had just recently started playing guitar, and that I didn't think anyone would want to hear anything that I knew how to play. Everybody had a good laugh at that. Willie knew that I was just looking for an autograph, and asked me to take the guitar out of its case and let him see it. He plucked a few strings, made an adjustment or two to the tuning, and played/sang a few bars of a song that I did not recognize. He then sat the guitar down and said \"Look, I'd love to sign this for you, but I just want to know something. What are you going to do with it? Are you going to put it up on eBay and make a few bucks? Are you going to hide it away in your closet and just bring it out when you want to tell your friends about the time you got to meet Willie Nelson? Or are you going to play it? This is a nice guitar, and I don't think that the guys over at Fender spent time making it just so it can sit in a closet collecting dust. If you can promise me you're gonna play it, I'll be happy to sign my name.\" I promised him that I would, and he took the silver paint marker a very clearly and legibly signed his name and the date. He signed just above the bridge, explaining that it would be less likely to be rubbed off in that location.\n\n\nIn the following years, I was lucky enough to meet Waylon and Merle Haggard, both of whom added their signature to my guitar, though neither took the care or time that Willie did.\n\n\nWillie, if you end up seeing this, I just want you to know that I've kept my word. I still play that guitar at least once a week. Thanks for taking a few minutes to make a young fan feel special. It meant more to me than I can ever express in words. \n\n\nOh, and happy birthday!\n\n\nEdit: Lots of people asking for a photo.

(The other parts are not too valuable, I'm not sure what happens to them)\n\nI know some of the bigger plants are in Germany and Japan.\n\nUsually a local aggregator will shred and bale it for efficient shipping and send it off to be smelted back into usable products.\n\n2) Does it wind up back in Australia?\n\nThe finished product is sold to the highest bidder regardless of location.\n\n3) What percentage is recycled?\n\nDepends on the methods, recycler, and the amount of money invested. I'm not familiar with this end of the process.\n\n4) Can loads be contaminated and therefor disposed of?\n\nNot qualified to answer\n\n5) Why don't you get paid for it? \n\nRecycling household waste is NOT a profitable venture (for most materials), the amount of labor, machinery, and energy required to turn it back into a finished product often costs more than it yields.\n\nThey make money by charging consumers, businesses, and municipalities money to do the work. People pay for it because of the impact they feel it has on the environment.\n\nHere are some examples for electronics that are worth something. These are the prices the recycler will get from an aggregator. They will pay a consumer half that. Unless you have a full truck load of material. They need to make tens of thousands of dollars every day. They don't care about buying 50-100lbs of this stuff:\n\n(Pricing in USD)\nComputer memory $14~$17 /lb\nComputer processors $2~$4\nComputer hard drives $0.75 /lb\nCircuit boards $0.75 ~ $3.75 /lb\n\nI think steel and aluminum are in the range of $0.05 /lb ish.\nAnd plastic and glass are less than that I would think.\n\nSo if you recycle 40 lbs of plastic, glass, and aluminum, we are talking about $2.50 in resale value maybe?\n\nNow think of the cost of the two guys in the truck to pick it up, the diesel to run it, the maintenance, the lease payments on the truck. The labor at the processing facility, the lease payments on the building and equipment, the cost to ship it, the insurance, workmanscomp, the costs to run a recycling business are quite extensive.\n\nAs an aside, it's more efficient to recycle aluminum than to mine and refine it.
