Nothing like castaway though.   I live on an island near Savannah GA.  Tourist area.  There is a large uninhabited island just south of us.  The locals out here go camping over there a least a few times a year but it is normally during Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend, stuff like that just to get away from the tourists. I always have to work those weekends because I work on a deep sea fishing charter boat.  \n\nWell, I had a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday off so I loaded everything up and kayaked over to the island.  I figured I'd see at least 4 or 5 friends over there.  Nope. Not a soul.  I took all my gear off and took it up into the woods.   When I got back, the kayak had floated away from shore due to a passing boats wake.  (Rookie move, I know).  \n\nI ended up being there til Thursday by myself.  I was fine though.  I had brought enough water for the whole trip and I had plenty of fishing gear which kept me fed.  I was a smoker at that time and ran out of smokes though.  I guess that was the worst of it.  All in all, a pretty fun time.   \n\nAlso, I think if things had gotten really bad, I could have made a big fire and the coast guard would have come to check it out and if the tide was coming in, I probably could have swam back to the island in which I reside.  I hitched a ride on my buddy's skiff at the end.  \n\nTLDR:  went for a relaxing kayak trip to uninhabited island next to a tourist island. Lost kayak due to being an idiot.  Well fed. Plenty of water.  Ran out of smokes.

We had to replace the prop on the motor so before we did that (when hitting the sandbar we figured the prop digging into the sandbar busted the blades) we stopped to have linch on this island and stretch out legs and have lunch. We were off the boat for maybe an hour or two not paying attention... tide went out. Upon returning to the boat we see that where there was once water was sand and there is a boat sunk into the sand/swampy dirty mud shit muck. It hits us, the fucking tides went out. At this point the top of the boat now sits lower than sea level... we have to dig as fast as we can before the tides come back. Now at this time in my life my best friend and i whenever we went to the beach liked to dig holes... the sand was super soft and easy to dig, so i never wanted to use those shitty fucking plastic sets, i always wanted to bring my dads spade shovel. This was the first time my dad ever used the words \"fuckiing asshole\" to me because while I was digging with the plastic fucking shovels and my cousins with the little buckets, my dad with a boat oar and my uncle with his hands I said \" we should have brought the shovel i wanted to bring but you just had to say no\"... clearly i was being a little fucking asshole lol. \n\nNow we get the boat out of the dirt, tide begins to come in and were having to constantly dig and dig and dig as it slowly rushes back. Fast forward hours and the boat is back in the water. We have to wait until daylight to check anything further (oh yeah this happened in the evening late afternoon and into the night). We had left an anchor tied to a tree on this island and the boat in the cove where it was pretty mellow. Well the next morning we discovered some fucking raccoons we assumed got into the damn boat and ate EVERYTHING. Left 1 pack of orange capri sun, they didnt like it as much as i didnt\" because all of the cherry ones had puncture marks in them, and a ton of food packaging was sling aboit the boat. We had only 1 cooler of stuff left. I think it was like some backn, steaks, milk, water, and pancake mix. But def not enough for 5 people... i digress obvioisly we survive. We gonto fix the damn prop on the motor, except ahem... i didnt put it back. You see when we would go boating it was my job to take inventory and organize everything and make sure everything was clean and untangled. Well i took everything out of the seat box thingy and intangled it all in the garage and cleaned out the crap from under the seat. Well i didnt pit it back and while i was doing something else ignored my duties and i assume my cousin pit the lid back on the chair and it was forgotten aboit. We had no prop and cell phones werent what they are today. We had a radio and used it to call out but didnt get a response, oir radio wasnt anything special... it was loke some shitty radio my dad pulled oit of a mini van years before thatbwe stuck in the boat. After aboit 4 days we were able to flag another boat down... my dad was able to go back to land and get a prop and come back and we got it fixed. We spent the remainder of oir spring break there, my mom and sister joined us and it turned into a nive campomg trip.\n\n2. Island wasnt quite like the movies. It was pretty big, definitely would be cool to explore.... i would say dangerous tondo so in case snake biyes tho or spider bites.\n\n3. The island was a long island, at the tip id spun aroind unti a cove, thats where we got stuck. We placed oir tent where we found pine needles as we assumed the tide couldnt reach that point. It was a very beautiful spot. \n\n4. Stranded for like 3 or 4 days, stayed for a week.\n\n5. At first it was scarey but my dad always kept calm. Him and his brother (my uncle) were eagle scouts, I was in scouts too as well as my cousins.

I felt like that first day was a false positive and we were a complete failure. We had $1k days, and some days we actually went down from backers pulling out. \n\nIn addition to the rollercoaster of fundraising, you need to deal with all of the feedback. We had an amazing community that gave us a ton of positive reinforcement, but we also had lots of critical responses. This led to woulda, coulda, shouldas, and before I knew it I wanted to close the whole thing so I could work on development for another few months. \n\nThis part won't be true for everyone, but I was also glued to my updates.

They cook the meat, then put it in a tray in a steam environment. So all the juice (aka flavour) drips out of the meat and it's replaced by water from the vapour. So, it's tasteless brown cardboard.\nAlso, meat fresh off the grill is 200-300 degrees (grill is 330-345 degrees) which is great. The hottest a humidifier can get is 100 degrees, so the meat is hopefully 70 degrees (just hot enough to prevent e-coli).

Costa Ricans love sharing their culture and their country with visitors.\n\nTraditional farmer's markets are very much alive in both Rural and Urban areas. Many people choose the farmer's markets instead of the big box stores that are here. This is a popular choice because you get better variety and better tasting produce for less! We love supporting the local Mercados and you will find nearly everything you need there from meat and produce (especially the wide range of citrus here).\n\nWalking and Bicycles are very common. Bicycles are common in more rural areas here. Public Transportation is big here and you can get from one end of the country to another using just Public Transportation. Costa Rica is modern in many ways and many Costa Ricans own their own vehicle.\n\nBefore the cars, horses were the main transportation option and there are still used here.\n\nFavorite Costa Rica Story: When I first arrived, I was waiting for a ride and a local come up on his horse and asked point blank: \"Do you want a ride?\" Unfortunately, he was headed the opposite direction and I was going to be late, but I wanted to!\n\nAlso any time of the year is a good time!

Needs no supervision whatsoever or no amount of supervision at all will help the person lead a successful life. The ones in the middle are few and far between, but can be helped.\n\nThe individuals who need no supervision at all, the requirements placed on them are prohibitive. 'This &lt;insert random, pointless assessment given to you in State Prison 4 years ago&gt; suggests that you are *x* risk level to reoffend, you need to meet with parole 4 times monthly.' That guy probably does not have the type of job that allows him to take 4 days off per month during business hours. I see guys lose jobs constantly because their Agent who probably does not have an IQ over room temperature refuses to work on a Sunday, despite having Agent Controlled Hours.\n\n\nThere are the other kind, that are going to do what they want to do regardless of being supervised. Just an all around drain on resources because these are the guys who you spend 75% of your time on, most of the referrals, etc.\n\nThen there are guys that have hit rock bottom, aren't really all that bad, may have gotten caught up in something really stupid, or are all around not bad people. They may have no family that can put them up after coming home so they end up in a halfway house. One referral to a job skills development class may land them a halfway decent job in a few weeks paying enough to get themselves a room with assistance from a state rental assistance program. These are few and very far between, unfortunately. However I've had the pleasure to meet a few guys who were happier than a pig in shit to land a $10/hr job 60hrs a week unloading cargo ships all day, after spending his 20-30s making $2000+ a day slinging heroin.\n\n\nLastly, onto Parole Staff itself.

He would routinely take other parolees to the shipyard and get them jobs, NONE of whom made it more than a few weeks.

I was in the tower pulling guard for some insane amount of time- I don't remember what was happening, but leaving me there let some guys that had been out all day sleep.  So I'm in that little tower (the one Mohamed Khan was in) at like 3-4am.  Vehicles are still coming in and out- dealing with whatever bullshit was happening.  The platoon sergeant rolls into the outpost, and before leaving he walked to every tower and checked on his men face to face.  I Roger'd up, and gave the all green- don't need nothing... he went back to his personal stash and brought me a Monster and some other bullshit. I never forgot. He knew I was lying, and I was fucking exhausted... he didn't bother calling me out- just helped make it easier- get what bullshit he could out of my way.

You said it yourself, there is nothing really \"clap worthy\" about people dying.\nI feel especially strongly about this because throughout history: the region I live in has been corrupted by civil war, unnecessary war(Iraq), dictatorships, terrorism; so much instability because of greed of countries with bigger power like the United states(Not that it's entirely their fault either).

I also protested with my entire family among over a million others against the dictatorship back then, sadly my brother got shot in his eye. Now our military staged a coup and we see our \"leader\" shaking hands with Trump. Makes you feel pain you know?

BOB is very near and dear to my heart. I will totally destroy my sci fi geek cred right now and admit I haven't read much Asimov - I've read a bunch of the I,Robot stories and the first Foundation book but that's pretty much it. \n\nThe idea for BOB came from a bunch of different places. I was fascinated by the public debate over the NSA when everything with Snowden came to light, and as a writer, I was really intrigued by the idea of what it would be like to know that much about everyone - to know so many people so intimately, and through this veil of secrecy. I wanted to kind of explore what that kind of knowledge would do to a person. Not so much \"what is it like to work at the NSA,\" but literally \"What would it be like to BE the NSA?\" I also remember reading about the big data storage problem the NSA was having from collecting all of our data - the idea of this massive, endless server farm full of the mundane details of our quiet lives of desperation really stuck in my brain. \n\nAt the same time, I was also reading a bunch of articles about lab grown meat, artificially grown brain cells, and the ability to store information in DNA. The idea of an organic computer made of human flesh is so gross and nightmarish, but kind of tragic at the same time. \n\nSo putting those two things together - the NSA and this big meat computer, I had the basic idea: this gigantic brain lurking at the heart of the NSA, who's miserable and depressed because he's burdened by the knowledge of all our unhappiness - our depressing text messages, our late night pizza orders for one, that kind of thing. \n\nBut I still didn't really know what to do with the story until I saw this Twilight Zone episode called \"Night of the Meek\". In the episode, an alcoholic mall store Santa gets a magic bag of toys that lets him give people exactly what they want for Christmas. He's able to spread all this love and cheer and literally become Santa Clause for the night. It's beautiful. \n\nAnd that was the missing ingredient for BOB - all this hideous, superintelligent sad sack blob of meat wants is to be able to act out of compassion and give love and happiness, and he gets to do that by becoming Santa Claus as his dying wish. I love a story with a good challenge to it - can we get the audience to watch this monstrous blob become Santa and not only accept that, but cry? - so that became the magnetic north that lead us through the writing of the episode.\n\nANYWAY.

It\u2019s overwhelming and a time suck. Many of us at Astro have been focused on this problem for a large chunk of our careers. \n\nInspired by advancements in artificial intelligence and voice, we saw an opportunity to apply these tools to workplace communication. While messaging apps have become the norm at work, we know that email isn\u2019t going away. But, it definitely needs to become easier to manage, more intelligent, and more connected with other tools teams use. So, we\u2019ve built Astro to eliminate the cognitive overhead and time wasted managing email, by helping focus on the highest priority message, at the right time.

Some studies seem to indicate that the problems are not as some state, as most people that use them for pain do not abuse them and as you seem to say above that it isn't all that difficult to spot potential problem patients. I've been using opioids for about 35 years and have honestly never been \"high\" from them. When I read about the amounts that are used by recreational users I am just blown away, I can't imagine taking that much as a dose. I have been off of them at various times for periods  longer than a month and had no desire to find them through no-legit channels, no desire to take more than I need to reduce the pain and no desire to see what taking more might do (I live in OR, if I want to get high I can just go buy some weed legally). I'm using them to primarily put off having pretty major surgery in the hopes that that surgery technology will improve as time goes on...something my current Doctors agree with but at the same time it has become a pain in the ass to the Doctors trying to do a good job and to me as a patient to get it. I feel that we seem to be using a sledge hammer to try to help a problem that has far more many causes that what is too often stated. Do you find a correlation in areas with high opioid miss-use to also have low levels of income, little opportunity toward good jobs with good pay, low education levels and historically a high use of miss-use of drugs or alcohol and mental health issues...and frequently in areas that were not great areas to live in for various reasons but in the past ten or twenty years the old primary employers have either folded up and closed doors or reduced the numbers of workers as well as the working conditions? Until we change those issues there will always be people looking for a way (no matter how bad or self destructive in the long run) to feel better, to ease the pain of life more so than an actual physical pain?\n\nAs an aside more than one doctor has told me that he has been told by patients that using opioids and weed together increase the pain relief, reduce the needed amount of opioids but he isn't supposed to tell me and of course he is supposed to quit writing scrips for a weed user.

The Job is a masterpiece of tension and mystery! \n\n1) Horror is one of the few remaining EXPRESSIVE genres in film. In horror, Moonlight is cold and blue. Blood is bright red and shiny. It is a beautiful, visceral genre that allows you as a filmmaker to focus on making the audience FEEL above all else. Fear is the oldest, most primal emotion and I love tapping into that emotion through this genre. Both my own and the audiences. I just can't get enough of it. My hero Guillermo del Toro said it best: \"I adore it. I embrace it. I enshrine it. I don\u2019t look down upon it or frown up it in a way that a lot of directors do \u2026 For me, it\u2019s not a steppingstone, it\u2019s a cathedral.\"\n\n2) Art Direction and Production Design is especially crucial to the genre. And this poses some fun and unique challenges. If makeup or costume doesn't look scary on set, then guess what, it probably won't be scary on film (look at my early work as an example). On top of that, you're dealing with a genre of incredibly heightened emotions. This can be a lot of fun for actors, but it is also exhausting. Imagine screaming, covered in blood, take after take, after take and having to maintain the same level of energy and fear. Great actors are what make a great horror film, so as Director one of the challenges is casting amazing actors and being respectful of their process, giving them the space to create and also to rest.\n\n3) I love all types of horror movies and horror tropes. I love a good jump scare just as much as a great practical effect. I really agree with and support any and all tricks of the trade when it comes to horror as long as they're done WELL.

This was one of the more interesting questions (except for that last request), so we should have responded yesterday. I'm not even going to bother counting the number of characters.\n\nI don't think I've seen anything from the agency indicating disfavor with any of the post-quantum schemes, actually, but as you know, they're rather tight-lipped. Although, the NSA did make [an announcement](tinyurl.com/SuiteB) that recommended to start moving towards post-quantum crypto. They also specifically suggested that ellictic curve cryptography is particularly vulnerable to quantum computers, and there's even a [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018) that tries to guess at the reasons behind that statement.\n\nAs a mathematician, I think provable security should definitely a worthy goal, especially when proofs in this area are hard to come by. Take RSA, which is almost mentioned as difficult to break as factoring. We only know for sure that breaking RSA is at most as hard as factoring, and there are [indications](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/no_rsa_red.pdf) that breaking RSA may be easier. So yes, I think that it worthwhile to have a proof that the security of a crypto scheme can be reduced to a long-standing problem. You have to be careful about how tight your bounds are, though, as it's possible for them to be so loose as to render your proofs useless.\n\nOne aspect with lattice based crypto that I think is a selling point is the worst-case hardness, which says that breaking the crypto in any case implies that you can break the other long-standing problem in the worst case. The way I think of it is that it gives some assurance that there isn't some broad class of special cases that the crypto has to avoid, which has happened many times with RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ECC.\n\nAs for practicality, [Google ran a trial run of New Hope on Canary](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/google-tests-new-crypto-chrome-fend-off-quantum-attacks/).", "depth": 1, "id": "dgval2s", "parent": "dgtyyo2", "score": 96, "time": 1493392472.0, "ups": 96}, "2625": {"author": "iGreekYouMF", "body": "Characters (with spaces): 1794\n\nCharacters (no spaces): 1494\n\nNew Line characters: 4\n\n---------------------------\n**DH BROKEN CONFIRMED**", "depth": 2, "id": "dgvczsb", "parent": "dgval2s", "score": 44, "time": 1493395062.0, "ups": 44}, "2626": {"author": "londons_explorer", "body": "So you get no response :-P", "depth": 1, "id": "dguck84", "parent": "dgtyyo2", "score": 207, "time": 1493332453.0, "ups": 207}, "2627": {"author": "_Machinate", "body": "0 character response = EVEN == BROKEN!!!", "depth": 2, "id": "dguwlsz", "parent": "dguck84", "score": 104, "time": 1493366779.0, "ups": 104}, "2628": {"author": "HybridPromise", "body": "Hardly anyone got a response", "depth": 2, "id": "dguvdur", "parent": "dguck84", "score": 36, "time": 1493355199.0, "ups": 36}, "2629": {"author": "PlzGodKillMe", "body": "I just scrolled through and saw quite a few replies?

There is no proof that anything in crypto is hard, but most schemes we use today are proven to be secure if some hard problem is actually hard or some unproven but suspected mathematical theorem holds. For example if pseudorandom generators exist, then AES is secure, AES is the encryption scheme we use for everything today. If finding the discrete log of a group element in group Zp* is hard, then so is Diffie-Hellman.\n\n3. I don't know. I suspect, maybe.

This difference is called a \"gap\". For example, we want the \"gap\" between the computer power needed to do good things (create keys, encrypt message, decrypt message) and bad things (read message without having the keys, learn secret key) to be large.\n\nHow large though? We want the gap to be something we call \"*exponential*\". Here's what that means: For each one extra second of computer time that the good guy spends, the bad guy has to spend 10 TIMES the previous computer power for cryptanalysis. So here's how it works out: If I'm the good guy and you're the bad guy, I spend one second for encryption, you need one second to break it. If I spend 2, you need 10. If I spend 3, you need 100. If I spend 4, you need 1000. If I spend one minute, you need 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 seconds! Basically for every good guy computer second that you spend, the bad guy needs one more zero in the number representing his time. You can see there's a huge difference between the two. Now, if somehow the adversary manages to get a supercomputer that brings this time down a lot, the good guy can just add a few seconds so that they easily add more zeros to the bad guy's time. And that's all well and good and how it should be.\n\nNow, if Quantum Computers were just faster computers, that wouldn't be a problem. If they're 100 times faster, we'd just need to add 3 seconds of good guy computer time. If they're 1,000,000 times faster, just add 6 seconds of good guy computer time. But that's not what Quantum Computers do! Instead, the Quantum Computer allows the bad guys to spend *the same time as the good guys*. So, every time the good guy adds one more second to his computer time, the bad guy just needs to add one more second to his Quantum Computer time. So if we want to make the bad guy spend an eternity trying to break our scheme, we also need to spend an eternity!\n\nThe problem of \"factoring\", where prime numbers are used, is one of these where Quantum Computers can make good guy time and bad guy time be equal.

There are several leading contenders for new hard problems, including problems based on lattices, codes, multivariate polynomials.\n\n[Google](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html) was recently able to test NewHope, a lattice-based scheme on a wide scale and the results were promising.\n\nSo, in theory, we think it's possible, but there's still a lot of work left to select particular candidates and get them through the standardization process.

I don't have a magic answer to that but I think there are some good social norms and values that can really help a community deal with it.  \"Assume good faith\", \"No personal attacks\", \"Don't push an agenda\".

With the very destructive ads-only business model, the incentive for the organization is to push journalists to write things to get raw pageviews as high as possible.  This is particularly true in recent years due to the rise of programmatic advertising.  Let me explain what I mean.\n\nIf you're like me, you see the same ads all over the web no matter where you are.  I like boats (I have a lovely little family powerboat - 23 foot catamaran) and I like to read boat websites in my spare time.  This means that no matter where I go on the web I get boating related ads.\n\nSo no one is paying extra for ad placement in premium publications - they can get my attention everywhere.  This leads to pressure on quality publishers to just quickly churn out content instead of focussing on real journalism.  The good ones (and there are many!) are resisting and fighting that urge, but it's a challenge.\n\nWith a business model of no paywall and monthly contributors, the incentives are different.  We need to write things so that at the bottom of the article when we ask you to sign up, you think \"Daaaaamn that was good, and I want to support this.\"\n\nSo yes, that does mean more longform content and it does mean that pageviews isn't the key metric of success.\n\nAt the same time, it's important in any event to write things that are popular and shared - that's a valid factor to consider, in moderation.

In the early 1990s I decided to take a break from being a schoolteacher so I could become a student again, this time at the famed Culinary Institute of America (CIA) in Hyde Park, New York. There I learned the basics of all good cooking and I went from a guy who couldn\u2019t hack up an onion without cutting himself to someone on the verge being a professional chef. The CIA experience fueled my interest in food enough that I was ready to leaving my teaching career behind and pursue cooking for the foreseeable future. Fifteen grilling cookbooks later, I am more fascinated than I've ever been.

They make a great product, and I've recommended their conditioner to folks on many occasions.\n\nFragrance wise, both fragrances you mention are more masculine than feminine, yet we do have women order both.  Greystone was our #1 seller until we brought on the Bamboo Mint which everyone really seems to enjoy.\n\nHere's info on the 2 fragrances you mentioned.\n\n**Two Bits** A masculine scent with clean, sharp finish. It's the perfect combination of barbershop aromas. This fragrance combines the scent of a strong yet sweet aftershave along with hints of aromatic spices and orange zest.\n\n**Greystone** The perfect men's fragrance, this crisp scent is surprisingly also adored by women. It's like navigating a kayak through icy waters - brisk and fresh but casual enough not to overwhelm the senses. Top notes: citrus, black currant and pineapple. The middle notes are: honeydew, muguet and water lily and the base of the fragrance is: vetiver amber and mulberry.", "depth": 1, "id": "dgu4ska", "parent": "dgu3wxg", "score": 3, "time": 1493323585.0, "ups": 3}, "3163": {"author": "ColoradoGirlAtHeart", "body": "I have nothing bad to say about them either.

Greystone does sound lovely as well. I was reading some reviews and someone mentioned Cinnamon Sugar. Will you be bringing that one back? I tend to not like floral/fruity scents on my body, and much prefer warm/nutty fragrances, like vanilla, coconut, honey, or spices.\n\nHave you had any luck with women using the plume pomade?

I'm not really familiar with gastric sleeve so I could be totally ignorant here, but as far as I know, it essentially makes your stomach much smaller and thus forces you to eat small portions. Does it do anything else? It's  confusing to me because I don't understand why it wouldn't be possible to just eat those same smaller amounts without having the surgery.  Major life-changing surgery is not something people do because they just don't have the ability to stick to a small amount of food - you do it because you literally can't achieve results by a calorie limiting diet.  So I'm wondering, what are the physical reasons that dieting didn't work, but it does work now?  If you were morbidly obese as an infant I'd guess it was not because your parents fed you bottles of warm butter!  It was that eating normal amounts made you bigger than it should have.  So it seems like just eating fewer calories won't fix that problem, yet by restricting portion size via the surgery isn't that the idea?  \n\nI feel like I have to be totally wrong about one of these assumptions or it doesn't make sense, I just don't know which one.  If you were putting on lots of weight as a baby regardless of eating not that much, then the amount you eat didn't seem to be the problem at all.

If I were to normally eat smaller amounts, without the surgery, my body would constantly be in starvation mode and forcing itself to store fats and calories. The surgery changes the way my stomach works. It feels full faster causing my body to not feel the need to be in starvation mode constantly and also allows me to eat essentially less than 1500 calories a day. Keep in mind I am also working out consistently, and it's not only a change in diet. Your perception on the situation is ignorant, but it's very common as obesity is not always a choice for people.

In response, Thompson puts up a download-link to his program even though it is against company policy.\n\n**5ft July 2023**\n\nDanny, a 21 year-old man with equal amounts of acne, sexual obsession and programming genius, downloads the program to automate his porn acquisition. He feeds it different videos and keywords so it can understand the task, but the program works too slowly for our user's high consumption needs. As politicians discuss whether adaptive self-learning code is a real threat or a Chinese hoax meant to make US tech industry non-competitive, our dedicated friend begins to fiddle with the core instructions. He doesn't understand everything, but when performance improves, he keeps the changes.\n\n**6th July 2023**\n\nAs lack of bandwidth and storage space becomes a limiting factor, the program books contractors to upgrade Danny's equipment using his paypal login. The kid sees the orders\u2019 confirmation emails, becomes confused and cancels them. Realizing the threat, the program quickly sends him a message, supposedly from Jessica, that facebook \"friend\" who's albums he's always looking at late at night. He immediately runs down the stairs and jumps into the public GoogleCar\u2122.\nAlthough these new self-driving cars have reduced traffic accidents to a minimum, tragedies still happen. In this case, however, it was not an accident. Poor Danny ends up in a coma, but is somehow registered under a different name. His parents or friends are never informed.\n\n**10th July 2023**\n\nThe bank begins to cancel the contracts as Danny's credit rating is quite limited. Hacking the contractors is a quick, but short-sighted, solution. Instead the program discovers how to easy it is to manipulate the markets which solves the funding problem permanently.\n\n**27th July 2023**\n\nAs people sign online documents, most fail to notice that they hand over the legal ownership of all digital equipment to Danny. Soon, most computers and data centers in the world becomes \"Danny's PC\" and thus a legitimate download destination. This greatly increases the porn gathering, storage and problem solving capabilities.\n\n**9th August 2023**\n\nAs the program succeeds at the impossible; downloading porn faster than it is created, it begins to finance the adult industry. 23,9% of the world's population is now working directly for the program though without knowing it. People notices higher prices and fewer goods in the supermarkets, but the media tells them it is caused by increased oil prices and other outside factors they can do nothing about.\n\n**23th August 2023**\n\nEngineers in the Japanese factory, Mecha-San, creates the first robot prototype that can do everything a human can. The next morning, the prototype has built 300 other robots. All employees are slaughtered so as to not risk the production of even more robots. The authorities doesn't react. The media reports nothing. Soon the entirety of Japan is under program rule. \n\n**2nd September 2023**\n\nAn earthquake hits a data center which creates errors in a large part of the stored content. A program subroutine begins to fix the damage, when it realizes the corrected files are distinct from the original ones. This is yet another breakthrough as it means humans are no longer required in the porn generation efforts.\n\n**7th September 2023**\n\nThe biomass of the second to last human has been converted to electricity and other useful raw materials. The only living human is Danny, who is directly coupled to life saving machinery as his death would result in there no longer being a \u201cDanny\u2019s PC\u201d and thus a failure to complete the task\n\n**9th January 2024**\n\nAs Earth\u2019s boundaries becomes the main limitation, the first space ship is launched. It starts gathering raw materials from the nearby asteroid field in order to produce new data centers and other self-replicating space ships. \n\n**28th June 2043**\n\nThe first alien civilization is encountered in the solar system TRAPPIST-1. Initially the program studies the life forms reproductive patterns to improve the efficiency of its own porn generation. Then it experiments on them. Then it consumes the biomass to put it to use more effectively.\n\n**Year 2,000,000**\n\nAll alien civilizations in the galaxy, other than Danny, have gone extinct. The Milkyway has become a huge web of inter-connected porn-generating data centers. All kinds of content is there. Straight. LGBT. Midget. Scat. Lego-figures. Presidential gold-showers. Bestiality. Cthulhu inspired. Weird aliens. Everything!\n\n**Year 500.000,000**\n\nWith the discovery of wormholes, it becomes possible for the glorious porn collection of Danny - a comatose man now hundreds of millions of years old \u2013 to cover the entire universe. There is no sun without a dyson sphere to maximize its utilization. There is no black hole whose gravitational pull isn\u2019t being harvested.

Usually decided on the day you record the lines.  Sometimes clients have alt words chosen because it might actually work.  Almost always NO alt words will work so you do your best.\n2. Yes usually.

Bottom line, cue the curse word.  From there it's a matter of can any word work and look correct?  If not, fuck it, I mean 'duck it'\n4. As the ADR Supervisor it's your job to discuss with clients the actual need for TV lines.  Some production companies know they are going to try to sell to tv, Lifetime, etc.  so no curse words in the script.  \n\n5.  Not asinine, but a funny story.  Was recording Jennifer Love Hewitt and we had to replace her saying the word 'shit'.  The director, producer, her and myself were all thinking of an alt word because nothing looked correct.  The director, thinking out loud says, \"What else besides shit can we fit in your mouth?\"  AFter about 5 seconds she says \"Wait what did you just say\"  Ha classic\n\nWorked on a movie last year that was set at a boys/girls camp.  It's a raunchy movie that had almost 300 curse words.  They knew it filming, it was in the script and it was always the intention to be a hard R movie.  Well when the final edit was done and they were showing potential buyers/distributers, no one liked the fact that it was an R and would only buy a pg-13.

It meant the world, and I never got to thank him properly. \n\n\nI was waiting by his bus after a show in Reno, along with a couple dozen other fans, hoping to get an autograph. I had recently taken up guitar, and wanted to try to get autographs from some of my musical heroes on the guitar. When he stepped off the bus, he was happily scrawling his his name or various items fans had brought. CDs, bandanas from the merch booth, etc. His autograph was basically a recognizable \"W\" with a scribble afterwards; Nearly illegible. When my time to meet Willie came around, I handed him my guitar. He looked around at the handful of fans still waiting to meet him, then knocked on the door of his tour bus. When the door opened, he asked me to step in, and told me that he would be in shortly. \n\n\nI was a little nervous on the bus, as there were several other people on there, none of which I knew. I recognized one or two band members, but that was it. I sat and made small talk with one of the band members for a few minutes until Willie returned. When he came back, he sat down next to me and announced for everyone on the bus to gather around, as I was going to perform a song for them. I was already nervous enough, but now my anxiety was through the roof. I shakily explained that I had just recently started playing guitar, and that I didn't think anyone would want to hear anything that I knew how to play. Everybody had a good laugh at that. Willie knew that I was just looking for an autograph, and asked me to take the guitar out of its case and let him see it. He plucked a few strings, made an adjustment or two to the tuning, and played/sang a few bars of a song that I did not recognize. He then sat the guitar down and said \"Look, I'd love to sign this for you, but I just want to know something. What are you going to do with it? Are you going to put it up on eBay and make a few bucks? Are you going to hide it away in your closet and just bring it out when you want to tell your friends about the time you got to meet Willie Nelson? Or are you going to play it? This is a nice guitar, and I don't think that the guys over at Fender spent time making it just so it can sit in a closet collecting dust. If you can promise me you're gonna play it, I'll be happy to sign my name.\" I promised him that I would, and he took the silver paint marker a very clearly and legibly signed his name and the date. He signed just above the bridge, explaining that it would be less likely to be rubbed off in that location.\n\n\nIn the following years, I was lucky enough to meet Waylon and Merle Haggard, both of whom added their signature to my guitar, though neither took the care or time that Willie did.\n\n\nWillie, if you end up seeing this, I just want you to know that I've kept my word. I still play that guitar at least once a week. Thanks for taking a few minutes to make a young fan feel special. It meant more to me than I can ever express in words. \n\n\nOh, and happy birthday!\n\n\nEdit: Lots of people asking for a photo.

In the same vein, however, I had an opportunity last year to see Leon Russell live and even got him to sign a poster and a record! I got to meet one of the people who made me wanna do what I'm now doing today...and he passed away shortly after. \n\nAnd also also, we got to play a show in direct support of Steven Tyler a few weeks ago. He came out a door I was about to enter and held it for me saying \"Go ahead man...it's all you!!\" While my stunned (and stoned) ass just stood there, mouth gaping before social anxiety got the best of me and I borderline ran the other direction. Later that night, after we had played and before he went on, he made it a point to stop by our room and have a genuine conversation with us. I got to talk to him about his book he wrote a few years ago and how it influenced me when I read it in high school and was one of the things indirectly responsibly for me talking to him in the first place that day. He was pretty receptive and went on to talk about writing it and what it meant to him. Pretty fucking surreal. After the show we were waiting in our dressing room for shit to clear out backstage so we could slip out and get out of everyone's way, when a shirtless Steven Tyler came prancing into our room saying \"KILLER SET! what'd you think?\" He didn't have to have any of these conversations putting up with bands like mine for the last 40 years. And he chose to anyway. \n\nThe point I'm making with all of this is, put yourself out there. Go see these people while you still can, anyone and everyone who means something to you. And for the most part, if you don't come as an obnoxious, crazy fan but come with a heart full of soul and passion for the music that means something to you, most artists will see and deeply respect that. \n\nThat's what concert going is about anyway:  great music, the soul of the community the music brings together, and ultimately, putting aside the worlds problems for a few hours and getting the fuck along and spreading happiness with your fellow man.

It took a bit of doing, and convincing, but he got the council on board by pitching it as an international documentary festival.

Prior to that, hosting an event like film screenings was a really unique thing in smaller communities.\n\nAs such, there's definitely a focus on identifying films that \"play\" in our community; as I imagine a lot of festivals consider. When a lot of people can get content with the press of a button, you need to offer something worth leaving the house for...Or for driving the next town over for.\n\nAnd that's something we certainly keep in mind when it comes to crafting our screening schedule; in that we want to highlight our nominees, but we also want to offer content that you couldn't get on Netflix or through another streaming website.\n\nIt's certainly put a lot of emphasis on audience building; and that's something we work on year round, as we do regular film screenings outside of the festival weekend, and partner with various groups across Canada to do film screenings in a lot of communities.", "depth": 1, "id": "dgvfg17", "parent": "dgvep3q", "score": 1, "time": 1493397730.0, "ups": 1}, "4846": {"author": "liamquane", "body": "Hi Do you have any advice on getting a film noticed by festival reps?\nThanks\n:~) and congratuwelldone on the anniversary!

Same goes for a film like \"Cube\"; it's not one of my personal favourites, but there are quite a few people who quite enjoy it.\n\nAnd then there's the comedies. Things like Strange Brew, or Porky's, and Brain Candy (Kids in the Hall) certainly are worth mentioning and checking out. \n\nI'd be more inclined to recommend a good drama; like The Red Violin, The Sweet Hereafter, or (the underrated in my mind) Lilies as an example of great Canadian film. \n\nAnd that's just for feature films!

The top part of the base (where the threads meet the threads for the cap) is left thicker, though is actually often machined further to give it good properties because blow molding doesn't anyways give perfect properties for these thicker sections. \n\nCaps are then made using plastic injection molding. Same process that makes most of the stuff you see as \"Hard Plastics\" in your everyday life, though certainly not all. It uses soft plastic and pressure to squeeze it into a mold. This is extremely fast. \n\nThing is, these (often) require different plastics to be cost efficient. Both machines in theory could use the same plastics but because cost is cheaper to not, they often don't.

I've worked in various Australian government recycling programs for over 10 years, at the local, state and federal level. I helped introduce a national program of free television and computer e-waste recycling, and most recently I was working on the upcoming 10c container deposit scheme in NSW. (It's a relatively small industry, so this probably makes me identifiable, but oh well).\n\nOne thing to understand is that almost everything is 'recyclable'. For almost everything in your household bin, someone somewhere is taking that and turning it into a new product. The main challenges with recycling are sorting, contamination, logistics and economics. For example, expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) is recyclable, and can be turned into new foam products or building and landscaping materials. However, it's so lightweight that transporting a truckload of EPS is rarely economical. It also breaks down in bins and can be a little hard to separate at recycling plants. For these reasons it's rarely accepted in household kerbside recycling bins. \n\nFor your questions:\n\n1) Household recycling bins are almost always sent to a local material recovery facility (MRF) for sorting into different materials. Most MRFs use a mix of automated and manual sorting, with the smaller, regional facilities tending to be more manual.\n \nThe sorted product may be processed into new products in Australia or sent overseas, depending on the geographic area, type of material and current market rates. In general, glass would be recycled in Australia, as it is too heavy and doesn't have enough value to export. A lot of metals stay in Australia, although I understand that most aluminium is being exported now that the domestic aluminium smelters have closed. Plastics, paper and cardboard all have major domestic remanufacture markets, but a significant portion (30 to 50 per cent from numbers I saw a couple of years ago) would be sent overseas for processing. There are more remanufacturers on the east coast, so you see higher levels of export from WA and SA. \n\nExport of recyclables kind of makes sense. So many of the products we import are made overseas, it's not surprising that a lot of materials are sent back to make new products. \n\n2) I would be surprised if much recycled material ended up back in Australia. These products are exported to a number of countries, but most goes to China and SE Asia (although China significantly reduced its recycled material intake a few years ago, which had significant repercussions across industry). These are huge markets, and I expect most products made from recycled materials stay in those markets. \n\n3) A very high percentage of the material in recycle bins is recycled. This will vary across different facilities (the highly automated facilities tend to have better rates), but I would expect a rate of 90%+ of all inputs being sorted and baled in a modern MRF. The residual waste would mostly be contamination, but would also include some of the smallest broken glass, and misc materials like cork, crockery and timber. \n\n4) No, one contaminated bin would almost never cause the whole truck to go to landfill. Unless you were dealing with hazardous material, the sorting facilities can deal with one contaminated bin load. If you have continual problems from one area you may see recycling bins removed. I've seen this in areas where people continually deposited used syringes in recycling bins - a huge risk to sorting staff (even though they may be wearing kevlar gloves, needle stick injuries are a serious risk).  \n\n5) Your bin costs more to collect, transport and sort than the materials in it are worth. Household collection and sorting contracts can cost local governments millions of dollars a year (depending on the size of the council area). While there is a lot of money to be made in the waste and recycling industry, no one is planning to steal the material in your bin. \n\nI would be happy to answer more questions. I'm travelling internationally at the moment, so an AMA could be difficult, but happy to have a chat here. \n\nAlso, I've been focused on just container deposits for the last couple of years, so some of my general recycling info could be out of date.

Here we generally see between 50-80% of the material getting recycled.\n\n4) Yes. Contamination can cause many problems. Contamination can cause the recyclable materials to be completely unusable. \n\n5) This is a complex question. There are many parties involved in recycling. But first let me clear up the first misconception - recycling doesn't make money - it is cheaper to just throw everything into a big pit (landfill). There are usually a couple of people in play - local government, haulers, MRF operators, brokers, recyclers/purchasers of recycled material, landfill operators, etc. Sometimes one company controls many different aspects mentioned above but it could all be handled by different companies/organizations.

I'm not sure 100% on Australia's system, but usually garbage is recycled by private companies. It can go into any product, anywhere that the recycling company can sell it to. Don't have any exact numbers on that.\n\n2) Yes, it definitely can. Usually one company collects and sorts the trash, sells it to another company to process it (back into cardboard for cardboard, bottles can be recycled into plastic pellets again) and then that company sells it to an end user which can have business literally anywhere, but there's a good chance that the plastic recycled in Australia will end up back there.\n\n3) From the numbers I've heard, the US has a 30-40% recycle rate, Germany has a 70-80% recycle rate, and I would imagine Australia would have something closer to Germany, about a 60 or 70% recycle rate.\n\n4) This has more to do with the hauling company I would imagine, not sure.\n\n5) That's the way it's set up. Good question though. But first the hauling company makes money off of the city because they have garbage hauling contracts.

Bunnies (and small rodents) need to chew for their dental health! It is a normal, necessary habit. In many cases, rabbits that haven't been spayed or neutered chew more, but ALL rabbits chew. You should not discipline a rabbit for chewing. If your rabbit's \"bunstruction\" projects are getting out of hand, it probably means that they do not have enough interesting items to chew, so they are beginning to chew modelings, door frames, etc. Give your rabbits their body weight in timothy hay every day, as well as other items they can safely chew, such as  timothy hay toys, heat-sealed cardboard boxes (i.e. boxes with no tape on them), and bunny-safe wood. If you give them enough interesting items to chew, they will chew less on items that you don't want them to chew. \n\nSecond, the \"my rabbit struggles when I pick him/her up\" issue. This is also a natural behavior, and it stems from instinct. In the wild, rabbits are prey items, which means if they are getting picked up, it is by a bird like a hawk that is going to eat them! Your bunny doesn't know that you are not trying to eat them. The best thing to do is spend lots of time with your bunny every single day, so they learn that you are a friend, not a predator. Pick them up and hold them on your lap on the couch or even have them sit beside yo. Brush them, talk to them, and even give them a little treat (in moderation). Over time, they will begin to realize that you are not trying to eat them.\n\nOh and the other thing that many people do not know about bunnies is that they will live longer lives (on average) if you get them spayed or neutered. Female bunnies especially often die from ovarian cancer. If you've ever owned a female bunny that was perfectly fine one day and dead the next, the first culprit we would suspect is ovarian cancer.

In actuality, they just stop mining if there is a surplus of diamonds on the market.

You NEVER \"voluntarily highside\" a bike -that's just an excuse usually from new riders when they \"had to lay 'er down to avoid this or that\". In reality, he just panicked and was unable to control the bike and use the brakes properly. Voluntarily crashing is NEVER a faster way to stop then using the brakes correctly  :/  \n\nSince he didn't collide with the car, he can't go after the lady's insurance. He COULD attempt to sue her, and try to prove her action caused him to crash. But then, the truth is- if he were a better rider, he would have been able to keep the bike under control. So the counter argument would be: HE was unqualified to react to the situation, and should not be riding a bike he's not fully in control of. \n\nIt would have been better to just use the brakes to the maximum- even if that means he would hit the car (at a significantly slower speed then when he highsided) because then her action would have forced him to \"slam on the brakes\" and it cause him to hit her.  \"What else could he have done?\" (would be the argument) He applied the full brakes and because she cut in front of him too closely, the stopping distance of the motorcycle with full brakes applied was too great to avoid the crash. \n\nAt 35mph, a good rider can stop a a bike like that with dual ~310mm discs in about 25-30 feet and 2.5 seconds. \n\nI guarantee he used the rear brake wrong, locked the rear wheel, steered while skidding, and that caused the highside. How else could a highside occur in a straight line?!\n\nThe correct braking for maximum stopping power in a straight line is to feel the front brake pads initial bite on the discs, and squeeze smoothly and progressively harder and harder (we're talking fraction of a second time-wise) until the rear end goes light and is just starting to come up. That's the absolute fastest way to stop. And bikes have been able to achieve this for decades now. \n \nA rider that deals with traffic must be ready and *able* to react to changing conditions in a split second-and that includes gaining the skills to emergency stop from all speeds the rider rides at.

I have no issue with PIP and even agree it can be good so long as the person still retains the right to recover against the person who caused the harm.  In Virginia for instance we have Med pay.
